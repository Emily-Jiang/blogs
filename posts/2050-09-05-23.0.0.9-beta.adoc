The Open Liberty 23.0.0.9-beta release continues to make progress on two features that have been made available via previous betas: Spring Boot 3 support and the Jakarta Data preview.

The Liberty Spring Boot Support 3.0 feature provides more complete support for running a Spring Boot 3.0 application on Liberty. It also provides the capability to "thin" the application when you create applications in containers. More information is available in the link:{url-prefix}/blog/2023/08/03/23.0.0.8-beta.html#sp3[Spring Boot 3 support in Open Liberty 23.0.0.8-beta] blog post.

Jakarta Data is a new Jakarta EE specification being developed that aims to standardize the popular Data Repository pattern across a variety of providers.  More information is available in the link:{url-prefix}/blog/2023/07/11/23.0.0.7-beta.html[Jakarta Data beta 2 update in Open Liberty 23.0.0.7-beta] blog post.

The 23.0.0.9-beta release also includes link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/feature/feature-overview.html[all GA features].


[#run]
=== Try it now 

To try out these features, update your build tools to pull the Open Liberty All Beta Features package instead of the main release. The beta works with Java SE 20, Java SE 17, Java SE 11, and Java SE 8.

If you're using link:{url-prefix}/guides/maven-intro.html[Maven], you can install the All Beta Features package using:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>RELEASE</version>
    <configuration>
        <runtimeArtifact>
          <groupId>io.openliberty.beta</groupId>
          <artifactId>openliberty-runtime</artifactId>
          <version>23.0.0.9-beta</version>
          <type>zip</type>
        </runtimeArtifact>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

You must also add dependencies to your pom.xml file for the beta version of the APIs that are associated with the beta features that you want to try.  For example, for Jakarta Data Beta 2, you would include:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>jakarta.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>jakarta-data-api</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0-b2</version>
</dependency>
----

Or for link:{url-prefix}/guides/gradle-intro.html[Gradle]:

[source,gradle]
----
dependencies {
    libertyRuntime group: 'io.openliberty.beta', name: 'openliberty-runtime', version: '[23.0.0.9-beta,)'
}
----

Or if you're using link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/container-images.html[container images]:

[source]
----
