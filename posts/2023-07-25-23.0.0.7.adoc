[#javadoc]
== Liberty API and SPI Javadoc
Before the Open Liberty 23.0.0.7 release, developers who were working with Liberty APIs and SPIs had to use the embedded Javadoc that comes packaged with the runtime or build their own Javadocs from source.  Starting with 23.0.0.7, we've added the API and SPI Javadoc to the Open Liberty Docs, alongside the Javadoc for MicroProfile, Jakarta EE, and Java EE.  We've also retroactively added the Javadoc for 23.0.0.6.

To start using the hosted Javadoc, navigate to the **REFERENCE** section of the link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/overview.html[Open Liberty Docs]. 

[#bugs]
== Notable bugs fixed in this release


We’ve spent some time fixing bugs. The following sections describe just some of the issues resolved in this release. If you’re interested, here’s the  link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues?q=label%3Arelease%3A23007+label%3A%22release+bug%22[full list of bugs fixed in 23.0.0.7].

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/25368[GlobalOpenTelemetry is missing public methods]
+
Liberty overrides the `GlobalOpenTelemetry` class to return a no-op.  Liberty does not allow users to set the class and, instead, CDI injection should be used to acquire an `OpenTelemetry` object.
+
However the override is missing public methods, which causes an error to occur if called.  For example:
+

This issue now resolved and calling a method on `GlobalOpenTelemetry` delegates to the no-op `OpenTelemetry` class.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/19861[Concurrency errors when using same JWT access token for inbound propagation]
+
For a Liberty server configured with the`openidConnectClient-1.0` feature and using the same JWT access token for inbound propagation for multiple requests, a concurrency error occurs that causes the requests to fail.  This error results in a `ConcurrentModificationException`:
+

This issue has been resolved. The `ConcurrentModificationException` is not longer thrown and the requests succeed.
