[#javadoc]
== Liberty API and SPI Javadoc
Prior to the Open Liberty 23.0.0.7 release, when working with Liberty APIs and SPIs developers had to use the embedded Javadoc that comes packaged with the runtime (or build their own from source).  Starting with 23.0.0.7, we've also made the Javadoc available on the Open Liberty documentation page, alongside the other Javadoc for MicroProfile, Jakarta EE and Java EE.  We've also retroactively made the Javadoc available for 23.0.0.6.

To start using the hosted Javadoc, navigate to the REFERENCE section of the link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/overview.html[docs]. 

[#bugs]
== Notable bugs fixed in this release


We’ve spent some time fixing bugs. The following sections describe just some of the issues resolved in this release. If you’re interested, here’s the  link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues?q=label%3Arelease%3A23007+label%3A%22release+bug%22[full list of bugs fixed in 23.0.0.7].

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/25368[GlobalOpenTelemetry is missing public methods]
+
Liberty overrides the `GlobalOpenTelemetry` class to return a no-op.  Liberty does not allow users to set the class and, instead, CDI injection should be used to acquire an `OpenTelemetry` object.
+
However the override is missing public methods, which causes an error to occur if called.  For example:
+
[source]
----

This issue now resolved and calling a method on `GlobalOpenTelemetry` delegates to the no-op `OpenTelemetry` class.

During server start with `com.ibm.ws.tcpchannel.useZosAio=true` specified, an FFDC is created when running with Java 17 on z/OS:

This issue has been resolved and the FFDC is no longer produced.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/19861[Concurrency errors when using same JWT access token for inbound propagation]
+
For a Liberty server configured with `openidConnectClient-1.0` using the same JWT access token for inbound propagation for multiple requests, there is a concurrency error which causes the requests to fail.  This results in a `ConcurrentModificationException` occurring:
+
[source]
----

This issue has been resolved; the `ConcurrentModificationException` is not longer thrown and the requests succeed.
