== Try out beta support for Java 23


Java 23 is the latest release of Java, expected out this month (September 2024). It contains new features and enhancements over previous versions of Java. However, Java 23 is not a long-term support (LTS) release and support for it is dropped after the next version of Java is supported. It offers some new functionality and changes that you are going to want to check out for yourself.

[#samesite]
== Check for Samesite=None incompatible clients

In 24.0.0.10-beta, you can now use `SameSite=None` cookies without the worry of breaking certain client versions. Previously, cookies with the `SameSite=None` attribute were rejected or mishandled (treated as `SameSite=Strict`) if they were sent to an link:https://www.chromium.org/updates/same-site/incompatible-clients/[incompatible client version]. Now, Open Liberty intercepts cookies with the `SameSite=None` attribute before they are sent to the web browser and checks if the `User-Agent` specifies an incompatible client version. If an incompatible client is detected, the `SameSite=None` and `Partitioned` headers (if present) are removed from the cookie.

For more information, see link:{url-prefix}/blog/2020/03/25/set-samesite-attribute-cookies-liberty.html[Setting the SameSite attribute on cookies with Open Liberty].

== Try it now

To try out these features, update your build tools to pull the Open Liberty All Beta Features package instead of the main release. The beta works with Java SE versions:

* Java SE 23
* Java SE 22
* Java SE 21
* Java SE 17
* Java SE 11
* Java SE 8


If you're using link:{url-prefix}/guides/maven-intro.html[Maven], you can install the All Beta Features package by using:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.10.3</version>
    <configuration>
        <runtimeArtifact>
          <groupId>io.openliberty.beta</groupId>
          <artifactId>openliberty-runtime</artifactId>
          <version>24.0.0.10-beta</version>
          <type>zip</type>
        </runtimeArtifact>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

You must also add dependencies to your pom.xml file for the beta version of the APIs that are associated with the beta features that you want to try. For example, the following block adds dependencies for two example beta APIs:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.example.spec</groupId>
    <artifactId>exampleApi</artifactId>
    <version>7.0</version>
    <type>pom</type>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>example.platform</groupId>
    <artifactId>example.example-api</artifactId>
    <version>11.0.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----

Or for link:{url-prefix}/guides/gradle-intro.html[Gradle]:

[source,gradle]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'io.openliberty.tools:liberty-gradle-plugin:3.8.3'
    }
}
apply plugin: 'liberty'
dependencies {
    libertyRuntime group: 'io.openliberty.beta', name: 'openliberty-runtime', version: '[24.0.0.10-beta,)'
}
----


Or if you're using link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/container-images.html[container images]:
