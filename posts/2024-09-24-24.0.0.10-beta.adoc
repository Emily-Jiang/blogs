[#SUB_TAG_0]
== Beta support for Java 23


Java 23 is the latest release of Java, expected out this month (September 2024). It contains new features and enhancements over previous versions of Java. However, Java 23 is not a long term support (LTS) release and support for it will be dropped once the next version of Java is supported. It offers some new functionality and changes that you are going to want to check out for yourself.

[#SUB_TAG_1]
== SameSite=None incompatible Clients

Please provide a summary of the update, including the following points:
   
- A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.
`Some web browser versions are incompatible with the SameSite=None attribute meaning they will either reject the cookie or treat it incorrectly. With this implementation change, if the web browser (specified in User-Agent) is detected as one of the incompatible clients then the SameSite=None header, and Partitioned (if applicable/present), will be removed from the cookie allowing it to be processed.`
- The Human-readable name and short feature name for your feature- eg WebSockets feature (websockets-1.0).
`N/A`
- Who is the target persona? Who do you expect to use the update? eg application developer, operations.
`Application/Web developers`
- What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)
`Previously, cookies with the SameSite=None attribute would be rejected or mishandled (treated as SameSite=Strict) if they were sent to an incompatible client version specified link:https://www.chromium.org/updates/same-site/incompatible-clients/[here]. This update intercepts cookies before sending them to the web browser by checking if the User-Agent specifies an incompatible client. If an incompatible client is detected the SameSite=None and Partitioned headers (if present) will be removed from the cookie. This change should allow for easier development as SameSite=None cookies can now be used without the worry of breaking specified versions. `
- Briefly explain how to make your update work. Include screenshots, diagrams, and/or code snippets, and provide a `server.xml` snippet.
`This update internally handles the removal of the SameSite=None attribute, so there is nothing that needs to be done to make the update work.`
 - Where can they find out more about this specific update (eg Open Liberty docs, Javadoc) and/or the wider technology?

To enable the new beta features in your app, add them to your `server.xml`:

[source, xml]
----

----

[#run]
=== Try it now

To try out these features, update your build tools to pull the Open Liberty All Beta Features package instead of the main release. The beta works with Java SE 21, Java SE 17, Java SE 11, and Java SE 8.
// // // // // // // //
// In the preceding section:
// Check if a new non-LTS Java SE version is supported that needs to be added to the list (21, 17, 11, and 8 are LTS and will remain for a while)
// https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/java-se.html
//
// In the following section:
// Check if a new MicroProfile or Jakarta version is in beta that could replace the example values in the codeblock
// // // // // // // //

If you're using link:{url-prefix}/guides/maven-intro.html[Maven], you can install the All Beta Features package using:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.8.2</version>
    <configuration>
        <runtimeArtifact>
          <groupId>io.openliberty.beta</groupId>
          <artifactId>openliberty-runtime</artifactId>
          <version>24.0.0.10-beta</version>
          <type>zip</type>
        </runtimeArtifact>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

You must also add dependencies to your pom.xml file for the beta version of the APIs that are associated with the beta features that you want to try. For example, the following block adds dependencies for two example beta APIs:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.example.spec</groupId>
    <artifactId>exampleApi</artifactId>
    <version>7.0</version>
    <type>pom</type>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>example.platform</groupId>
    <artifactId>example.example-api</artifactId>
    <version>11.0.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----

Or for link:{url-prefix}/guides/gradle-intro.html[Gradle]:

[source,gradle]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'io.openliberty.tools:liberty-gradle-plugin:3.6.2'
    }
}
apply plugin: 'liberty'
dependencies {
    libertyRuntime group: 'io.openliberty.beta', name: 'openliberty-runtime', version: '[24.0.0.10-beta,)'
}
----
// // // // // // // //
// In the preceding section:
// Replace the Maven `3.8.2` with the latest version of the plugin: https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.openliberty.tools/liberty-maven-plugin
// Replace the Gradle `3.6.2` with the latest version of the plugin: https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.openliberty.tools/liberty-gradle-plugin
// TODO: Update GHA to automatically do the above.  If the maven.org is problematic, then could fallback to using the GH Releases for the plugins
// // // // // // // //
