== Jakarta Restful Web Services 4.0 (EE11)

Jakarta RESTful Web Services provides a foundational API to develop web services based on the REST architectural pattern. The Jakarta Restful Web Services 4.0 update, introduces several enhancements to make web service development more efficient and effective.

The new features, `restfulWS-4.0` and `restfulWSClient-4.0`, are primarily aimed at application developers. This release brings incremental improvements that are made to Jakarta RESTful Web Services provided in the 4.0 release of that Jakarta project. It provides new convenience API methods:

- The `containsHeaderString()` method has been added to `ContainerRequestContext`, `ContainerResponseContext`, and `HttpHeaders` to help determine whether a header contains a specified value.
- The `UriInfo.getMatchedResourceTemplate()` method is a new addition that returns a full template for a request.
- New `MediaType` values have been introduced, including `APPLICATION_JSON_PATCH_JSON` and `APPLICATION_MERGE_PATCH_JSON`, to handle specific media types.

These updates aim to streamline the process of developing RESTful services. To implement these new features, add the following to your `server.xml` file.

For the RESTful web services feature.
[source,xml]
----
<featureManager>
    <feature>restfulWS-4.0</feature>
</featureManager>
----

For the RESTful web services client feature.
[source,xml]
----
<featureManager>
    <feature>restfulWSClient-4.0</feature>
</featureManager>
----

For more information, see the Jakarta RESTful Web Services 4.0 link:https://jakarta.ee/specifications/restful-ws/4.0/[specification] and the link:https://jakarta.ee/specifications/restful-ws/4.0/apidocs/jakarta.ws.rs/module-summary[Javadoc].

[#monitor10]
== Enhanced HTTP Request Monitoring with Monitor 1.0

Open Liberty introduces a significant update that enhances the tracking of HTTP connections that are made to the server. With the Monitor-1.0 feature (`monitor-1.0`) and any JEE10 feature that uses the servlet engine, Open Liberty can now record detailed information about HTTP requests into an `HttpStatsMXBean`. This includes the request method, response status, duration, HTTP route, and other attributes that align with the Open Telemetry HTTP metric semantic convention.

If `mpMetrics-5.0` or `mpMetrics-5.1` is also active, Open Liberty creates corresponding HTTP metrics, such as `http.server.request.duration`, using a Timer type metric. To use these metrics effectively, it is essential to configure histogram buckets explicitly for `Timer` and `Histogram` type metrics by using the MicroProfile Metrics. For more details, see the `mp.metrics.distribution.histogram.buckets` property on the link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/microprofile-config-properties.html#metrics[MicroProfile Config Properties page].

This update ensures that operations teams responsible for monitoring, can now have a detailed and comprehensive view of HTTP requests, enhancing the monitoring and management capabilities within Open Liberty environments.

Previously, Open Liberty tracked servlet and JAX-RS/RESTful resource requests to the server as separate MBeans (servlet MBeans and REST MBeans). This data might then be forwarded to the mpMetrics feature to create corresponding metrics. Monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana could visualize this metric data to showcase server performance and responsiveness.

With the new update, HTTP connections are now tracked more comprehensively, combining request details into a unified `HttpStatsMXBean`. This approach simplifies monitoring and provides a more cohesive view of server performance, making it easier for operations teams to ensure optimal server responsiveness.

This enhancement is an auto-feature that activates with `monitor-1.0` and any feature that uses the servlet engine, currently supporting JEE 10 features like `servlet-6.0`, `pages-3.1`, and `restfulWS-3.1`. It also supports registering HTTP metrics with `mpMetrics-5.x` features. To enable this function, add the following to your `server.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<featureManager>
    <feature>monitor-1.0</feature>
    <feature>servlet-6.0</feature>
    <feature>mpMetrics-5.0</feature>
</featureManager>
----


For detailed configuration, see the link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/microprofile-config-properties.html#metrics[MicroProfile Config Properties page]. 

For more information about the HTTP semantic convention used, see the link:https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/http/http-metrics/#metric-httpserverrequestduration[Open Telemetry HTTP semantic convention] page.

[#faces41]
== Jakarta EE11 Faces 4.1

Jakarta Faces is a Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework for building web applications, offering many convenient features such as state management and input validation. The Jakarta Faces 4.1 (`faces-4.1`) update introduces a range of incremental improvements that are aimed at enhancing the developer experience. These enhancements include increased use of generics in FacesMessages and other locations. Improved CDI integration now requires events for `@Initialized`, `@BeforeDestroyed`, and `@Destroyed` for built-in scopes like FlowScoped and ViewScoped, and it allows injecting the current Flow into a backing bean. Also, a new UUIDConverter is added to the API, simplifying the handling of UUIDs.

This update also includes some deprecations and removals. The composite: extension tag and references to the Security Manager are removed, and the full state saving mechanism is deprecated. To enable the Jakarta Faces 4.1 feature in your application, add the following to your `server.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<featureManager>
    <feature>faces-4.1</feature>
</featureManager>

----

For more information, see the Jakarta Faces 4.1 link:https://jakarta.ee/specifications/faces/4.1/[specification] and the link:https://jakarta.ee/specifications/faces/4.1/apidocs/jakarta.faces/module-summary.html[Javadoc].

[#audit20]
== Use the Audit 2.0 feature to avoid generating unnecessary rest handler records

The Audit 2.0 feature (`audit-2.0`) is now in beta release. The feature is designed for customers that are not using rest handler applications. 
It provides the same audit records as the Audit 1.0 feature (`audit-1.0`) but it does not generate records for rest handler applications.

Customers that need to keep audit records for rest handler applications must continue to use the Audit 1.0 feature.

To enable the Audit 2.0 feature in your application, add the following to your `server.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<featureManager>
    <feature>audit-2.0</feature>
</featureManager>

[#run]
=== Try it now

To try out these features, update your build tools to pull the Open Liberty All Beta Features package instead of the main release. The beta works with Java SE 21, Java SE 17, Java SE 11, and Java SE 8.

If you're using link:{url-prefix}/guides/maven-intro.html[Maven], you can install the All Beta Features package using:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.10.3</version>
    <configuration>
        <runtimeArtifact>
          <groupId>io.openliberty.beta</groupId>
          <artifactId>openliberty-runtime</artifactId>
          <version>24.0.0.7-beta</version>
          <type>zip</type>
        </runtimeArtifact>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

You must also add dependencies to your pom.xml file for the beta version of the APIs that are associated with the beta features that you want to try. For example, the following block adds dependencies for two example beta APIs:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.example.spec</groupId>
    <artifactId>exampleApi</artifactId>
    <version>7.0</version>
    <type>pom</type>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>example.platform</groupId>
    <artifactId>example.example-api</artifactId>
    <version>11.0.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----

Or for link:{url-prefix}/guides/gradle-intro.html[Gradle]:

[source,gradle]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'io.openliberty.tools:liberty-gradle-plugin:3.8.3'
    }
}
apply plugin: 'liberty'
dependencies {
    libertyRuntime group: 'io.openliberty.beta', name: 'openliberty-runtime', version: '[24.0.0.7-beta,)'
