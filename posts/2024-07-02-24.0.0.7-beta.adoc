== Jakarta Restful Web Services 4.0 (EE11)

Please provide a summary of the update, including the following points:
   
   - A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.

> Jakarta RESTful Web Services provides a foundational API to develop web services following the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural pattern.

   - The Human-readable name and short feature name for your feature- eg WebSockets feature (websockets-1.0).

> restfulWS-4.0, restfulWSClient-4.0

   - Who is the target persona? Who do you expect to use the update? eg application developer, operations.
   
> These features are for application developers.

   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)

> This release represents in incremental improvements made to Jakarta RESTful Web Services provided in 4.0 release of that Jakarta project.  It provides new convenience API methods, such as the containsHeaderString() method in ContainerRequestContext, ContainerResponseContext, and HttpHeaders to determine if a Header contains a specified value, a new UriInfo.getMatchedResourceTemplate() method that returns a full template for a request, and also the addition of MediaType values APPLICATION_JSON_PATCH_JSON and APPLICATION_MERGE_PATCH_JSON.

   - Briefly explain how to make your update work. Include screenshots, diagrams, and/or code snippets, and provide a `server.xml` snippet.

```
   <featureManager>
        <feature>restfulWS-4.0</feature>

```
or

[#SUB_TAG_1]
== title_of_your_update

Please provide a summary of the update, including the following points:
   
   - A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.
   > When `monitor-1.0` and any JEE10 feature that utilizes the _servlet engine_ is active,  Open Liberty will now be able to track the HTTP connections made to the server and record that information into an `HttpStatsMXBean`. Included in this MBean will be information regarding the request method, response status, duration, HTTP route and many more attributes which correspond to the Open Telemetry HTTP metric semantic convention. If `mpMetrics-5.0` or `mpMetrics-5.1` is also active, corresponding HTTP metrics (i.e., `http.server.request.duration`) will be created to track these HTTP connections using a Timer type metric. Note that histogram buckets need to be explicitly configured for the `Timer` and `Histogram` type metrics with MicroProfile Metrics. Please see the `mp.metrics.distribution.histogram.buckets` property on the link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/microprofile-config-properties.html#metrics[MicroProfile Config Properties page].
   - The Human-readable name and short feature name for your feature- eg WebSockets feature (websockets-1.0).
   > N/A -> auto feature that will start with `monitor-1.0` and any feature using the servlet engine. Currently only supports JEE 10 features.
   - Who is the target persona? Who do you expect to use the update? eg application developer, operations. 
   > Operations to track http requests made to the server, duration and response type
   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)
   > Open Liberty can currently track servlet requests and JAX-RS/RESTful resource requests to the server as their own respective MBeans (i.e., servlet MBeans and REST Mbeans). The data can then be forwarded to the `mpMetrics` feature (if enabled) and respective servlet and REST metrics are created from this data. The metric data can then be used by monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus and Grafana) to visualize the performance and responsiveness of the server through various types of graphs.
   - Briefly explain how to make your update work. Include screenshots, diagrams, and/or code snippets, and provide a `server.xml` snippet. 
   > Auto-feature that will start with `monitor-1.0` and any feature that uses the servlet engine. Currently only supports JEE 10 features. For example: `servlet-6.0`, `pages-3.1`, `restfulWS-3.1`. Currently supports registering of HTTP metrics with `mpMetrics-5.x` features.

[#SUB_TAG_2]
== Jakarta EE11 Faces 4.1

Please provide a summary of the update, including the following points:
   
   - A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.
     > Jakarta Faces is a Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework for building web applications. It offers many convenient features, such as state management and input validation.

   - The Human-readable name and short feature name for your feature- eg WebSockets feature (websockets-1.0).
     > Jakarta Faces 4.0
     
   - Who is the target persona? Who do you expect to use the update? eg application developer, operations. 
     > These features are for application developers. 

   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)

     > As this is a minor release, it offers incremental improvements. For example, it increases the use of generics such as in FacesMessages and other locations.  It improves CDI integration by requiring events for `@Initialized`, `@BeforeDestroyed`, and `@Destroyed` for built-in scopes (FlowScoped & ViewScoped).  It's also now possible to inject the current Flow into a backing bean.  Another additional is a UUIDConverter as part of the API. 
     > 
     >  As for deprecation and removals, composite:extension tag has been removed and references to the Security Manager. Lastly, the full state saving mechanism has been deprecated. 

   - Briefly explain how to make your update work. Include screenshots, diagrams, and/or code snippets, and provide a `server.xml` snippet.

To enable the new beta features in your app, add them to your `server.xml`:

[source, xml]
----

----

[#run]
=== Try it now

To try out these features, update your build tools to pull the Open Liberty All Beta Features package instead of the main release. The beta works with Java SE 21, Java SE 17, Java SE 11, and Java SE 8.
// // // // // // // //
// In the preceding section:
// Check if a new non-LTS Java SE version is supported that needs to be added to the list (21, 17, 11, and 8 are LTS and will remain for a while)
// https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/java-se.html
//
// In the following section:
// Check if a new MicroProfile or Jakarta version is in beta that could replace the example values in the codeblock
// // // // // // // //

If you're using link:{url-prefix}/guides/maven-intro.html[Maven], you can install the All Beta Features package using:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.8.2</version>
    <configuration>
        <runtimeArtifact>
          <groupId>io.openliberty.beta</groupId>
          <artifactId>openliberty-runtime</artifactId>
          <version>24.0.0.7-beta</version>
          <type>zip</type>
        </runtimeArtifact>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

You must also add dependencies to your pom.xml file for the beta version of the APIs that are associated with the beta features that you want to try. For example, the following block adds dependencies for two example beta APIs:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.example.spec</groupId>
    <artifactId>exampleApi</artifactId>
    <version>7.0</version>
    <type>pom</type>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>example.platform</groupId>
    <artifactId>example.example-api</artifactId>
    <version>11.0.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----

Or for link:{url-prefix}/guides/gradle-intro.html[Gradle]:

[source,gradle]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'io.openliberty.tools:liberty-gradle-plugin:3.6.2'
    }
}
apply plugin: 'liberty'
dependencies {
    libertyRuntime group: 'io.openliberty.beta', name: 'openliberty-runtime', version: '[24.0.0.7-beta,)'
}
----
// // // // // // // //
// In the preceding section:
// Replace the Maven `3.8.2` with the latest version of the plugin: https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.openliberty.tools/liberty-maven-plugin
// Replace the Gradle `3.6.2` with the latest version of the plugin: https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.openliberty.tools/liberty-gradle-plugin
// TODO: Update GHA to automatically do the above.  If the maven.org is problematic, then could fallback to using the GH Releases for the plugins
// // // // // // // //
