Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an exciting and disruptive field that is already transforming businesses, and even entire industries, by enabling automation, improving decision-making and unlocking new insights from data. With the rise in large language models, or LLMs, such as ChatGPT, over the last few years there has been a significant shift in the performance of AI and its potential to drive enterprise value. So, how will this impact on software development and the creation of cloud-native Java applications for enterprises?

In this blog we'll explore what LLMs are, frameworks that can be used to simplify their use in Java applications and how to get started using them in a Jakarta EE/MicroProfile app:
* <<what_Are_LLMs, Find out what LLMs are>>
* <<Java_LLMs, Explore app frameworks that simplify the use of LLMs>>
* <<using_Langchain4j, Discover how LangChain can be used in Java applications>>
* <<tryout, Try out the jakartaee-microprofile-example application>>
* <<how_app_work, Learn how this sample application works>>

[#what_Are_LLMs]
== What are LLMs?

A language model is a model of natural language based on probabilities. They are able to generate probabilities of a series of words together. https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models[Large language models (LLMs)] are simply langauge models that are categorized by their large size.They are trained on immense amounts of data, possibly billions of paramters, using self-supervised and semi-supervised learning techniques. This makes them capable of understanding and generating natural language and other types of content to perform a wide range of tasks.

See the introductory video below for more information on LLMs, including what they are, how they work and business applications.

video::5sLYAQS9sWQ[youtube,width=70%,align="center"]

LLMs can be found in the service offerings of almost all of the major cloud service providers, e.g. IBM offers models through it's https://www.ibm.com/watsonx[watsonx] services, https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ai[Microsoft Azure] offers LLMs like Llama 2 and OpenAI GPT-4, and  https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/[Amazon Bedrock] offers models from a range of AI companies.

[#Java_LLMs]
== How can we take advantage of LLMs in Java applications?

Developing applications powered by large language models isn't always an easy task. Integrating AI/LLM capabilities into an application can be challenging. To make this easier, LangChain, an open source framework was developed in 2022 to help streamline the process of creating generative AI apps. 

LangChain provides tools and abstractions to improve the customization, accuracy, and relevancy of the information the models generate. For example, developers can use LangChain components to build new prompt chains or customize existing templates. LangChain also includes components that allow LLMs to access new data sets without retraining and organizes the large quantities of data these models require so that they can be accessed with ease. 

Although LangChain is primarily available in Python and JavaScript/TypeScript versions, there are options available to use LangChain in Java applications through community projects like https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j[LangChain4j]. LangChain4j APIs provide the ability to intergate LLMs into your Java application for different AI platforms, such as OpenAI and Hugging Face, etc.

[#using_Langchain4j]
== How to use LangChain4j in a Jakarta EE and MicroProfile application

Langchain4j has a very useful open source https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j-examples[langchain4j-examples] GitHub repositry where it stores example applications. However, although this repo provided useful examples of using LangChain4j in general Java apps, we could not find any examples showcasing how you could experience these AI technologies in a Jakarta EE/MicroProfile based application. So, we decided to build one ourselves called `jakartaee-microprofile-example` which can now be found in this https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j-examples[langchain4j-examples] GitHub repository. This demo application highlights how to use LangChain4j APIs in an application using Jakarta EE and MicroProfile on Open Liberty.


[#tryout]
== Try out the jakartaee-microprofile-example application

To see how you could apply LangChain4j to your own Jakarta EE and/or MicroProfile application, check out this example project for yourself.

[#pre-reqs]
=== Pre-requisites
Before you clone the application to your machine, install JDK 17 and ensure that your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set.  You can make use of the https://developer.ibm.com/languages/java/semeru-runtimes/downloads[IBM Semeru Runtime] as your chosen Java runtime. This runtime offers performance benefits from deep technology investment in projects such as Eclipse OpenJ9 and is available across a wide variety of hardware and software platforms. To find out more about IBM Semeru Runtime, see https://openliberty.io/blog/2022/08/19/open-liberty-semeru-performance.html[Open Liberty and Semeru Runtimes, cloud-native performance that matters].

The application uses Hugging Face. You need to get a Hugging Face API Key:

* Sign up and login to https://huggingface.co
* Go to Access Tokens by https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
* Create a new access token with "read" role

To access the repository remotely you'll need to install https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[Git] if you haven't already. You can clone the `langchain4j-examples` GitHub repository to your local machine by running:

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j-examples.git
----

[#env_setup]
=== Environment Set Up

To run the application, navigate to the `jakartaee-microprofile-example` directory:

[source]
----
cd langchain4j-examples/jakartaee-microprofile-example
----

and set the environment variables:

[source]
----
export JAVA_HOME=<your Java 17 home path>
export HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY=<your Hugging Face read token>
----

[#start_app]
=== Start the application

To start the application, use the provided Maven wrapper to run the https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/development-mode.html[Liberty dev mode]:


[source]
----
./mvnw liberty:dev
----

After you see the following message, the application is ready:

----

----

[#access_app]
=== Access the application

Once the application is running, you can access it through a browser of your choice at http://localhost:9080/ and start experimenting with it.

image::/img/blog/langchain4j-example-chat-room.png[Chat Room of LangChain4j Jakarta EE and MicroProfile example,width=70%,align="center"]

You can type in any text that you want to chat with the AI agent. Here are some suggested messages:

* `What is MicroProfile?`
* `Which top 10 companies contribute MicroProfile?`
* `any documentation?`


[#how_app_work]
== How does the application work?

The application demostrates how to use the LangChain4j APIs, https://openliberty.io/docs/ref/feature/#cdi-4.0.html[Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection], https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/feature/websocket-2.1.html[Jakarta WebSocket], https://openliberty.io/docs/ref/feature/#mpConfig-3.0.html[MicroProfile Config], and https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/feature/mpMetrics-5.1.html[MicroProfile Metrics] features.

[#create_service]
=== Creating the LangChain4j AI service

The application uses the `HuggingFaceChatModel` class to provide the model for building the AI service. 

See the {example-location}/src/main/java/dev/langchain4j/example/chat/ChatAgent.java[`src/main/java/dev/langchain4j/example/chat/ChatAgent.java`] file.
[source, java, role="no_copy"]
----
    public Assistant getAssistant() {
        ...
            HuggingFaceChatModel model = HuggingFaceChatModel.builder()
                .accessToken(HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY)
                .modelId(CHAT_MODEL_ID)
                .timeout(ofSeconds(TIMEOUT))
                .temperature(TEMPERATURE)
                .maxNewTokens(MAX_NEW_TOKEN)
                .waitForModel(true)
                .build();
            assistant = AiServices.builder(Assistant.class)
                .chatLanguageModel(model)
                .chatMemoryProvider(
                    sessionId -> MessageWindowChatMemory.withMaxMessages(MAX_MESSAGES))
                .build();
       ...
    }
----

Through the customized {example-location}/src/main/java/dev/langchain4j/example/chat/ChatAgent.java[`Assistant`] interface, the application can send messages to the LLM by its `chat()` method.

----
    interface Assistant {
       String chat(@MemoryId String sessionId, @UserMessage String userMessage);
    }
----

[#external_config]
=== Externalizing the configuration

As the above code, to access the model, an API key is required. For security practice, it is not hard-coded in the code. The application externalizes the API key and the LangChain4j model properties with the MicroProfile Config feature that helps the application to run in different environments without code changes. You can learn more from the https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/external-configuration.html[External configuration of microservices] document.

See the {example-location}/src/main/java/dev/langchain4j/example/chat/ChatAgent.java[`src/main/java/dev/langchain4j/example/chat/ChatAgent.java`] file.
[source, java, role="no_copy"]
----
    @Inject
    @ConfigProperty(name = "hugging.face.api.key")
    private String HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY;

    @Inject
    @ConfigProperty(name = "chat.model.id")
    private String CHAT_MODEL_ID;

    @Inject
    @ConfigProperty(name = "chat.model.timeout")
    private Integer TIMEOUT;

    @Inject
    @ConfigProperty(name = "chat.model.max.token")
    private Integer MAX_NEW_TOKEN;

    @Inject
    @ConfigProperty(name = "chat.model.temperature")
    private Double TEMPERATURE;

    @Inject
    @ConfigProperty(name = "chat.memory.max.messages")
    private Integer MAX_MESSAGES;
----

To fine tune the LangChain4j model or even try out another LLM, you simply update the values in the {example-location}/src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties[`langchain4j-examples/jakartaee-microprofile-example/src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties`] file or provide them through the enviroment variables.

----
hugging.face.api.key=set it by env variable
chat.model.id=NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO
chat.model.timeout=120
chat.model.max.token=200
chat.model.temperature=1.0
chat.memory.max.messages=20
----

[#communicate]
=== Communicating between the client and LLM

The application provides the interactive UI client for users to communicate with the LLM. Jakarta WebSocket enables two-way communication between the client and the `ChatService` service. Each client makes an HTTP connection to the service and send out the messages by the `send()` method.

See the {example-location}/src/main/webapp/chatroom.js[`src/main/webapp/chatroom.js`] file.
[source, java, role="no_copy"]
----
    const webSocket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:9080/chat');
    ...
    function sendMessage() {
        ...
        var myMessage = document.getElementById('myMessage').value;
        ...
        webSocket.send(myMessage);
        ...
    }
----

The service recieves the user messeages through the WebSocket `onMessage()` method, forward them to the LLM by calling the `ChatAgent.chat()` method, and then boardcast the LLM responsed answers back to the client session through the `sendObect()` method.

See the {example-location}/src/main/java/dev/langchain4j/example/chat/ChatService.java[`src/main/java/dev/langchain4j/example/chat/ChatService.java`] file.
[source, java, role="no_copy"]
----
    @OnMessage
    public void onMessage(String message, Session session) {
        ...
        try {
            ...
            answer = agent.chat(sessionId, message);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            ...
        }

        try {
            session.getBasicRemote().sendObject(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

    }
----

[#enable_metrics]
=== Enabling metrics

To determine the performance and health of the application, it uses the MicroProfile Metrics feature to collect how much processing time is needed for a chat by applying the `@Timed` annotation to the `onMessage()` method.

See the {example-location}/src/main/java/dev/langchain4j/example/chat/ChatService.java[`src/main/java/dev/langchain4j/example/chat/ChatService.java`] file.
[source, java, role="no_copy"]
----
    @OnMessage
    @Timed(name = "chatProcessingTime",
           absolute = true,
           description = "Time needed chatting to the agent.")
    public void onMessage(String message, Session session) {
        ...
----

And, collect how many agents are created by applying the `@Counted` annotation to the `AgentManager.createAgent()` method.

Visit the url http://localhost:9080/metrics?scope=application to check out the metrics.
----
# HELP chatProcessingTime_seconds Time needed chatting to the agent.
# TYPE chatProcessingTime_seconds summary
