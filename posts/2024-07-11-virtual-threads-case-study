//Blank line here is necessary before starting the body of the post.

While you can run your own apps using Java Virtual Threads on Open Liberty, our performance team concluded that, for now, we won’t be replacing Open Liberty’s existing autonomic thread pool with virtual threads.

InfoQ.com have today published our article about what the team found when they compared Java Virtual Threads with Liberty’s autonomic thread pool. Including some bugs which are still being investigated with the OpenJDK community.
