[#prerequisites]
== Before you start

=== Installing Java

Install either Java 17 or Java 21. You can link:https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/semeru-runtimes-installation[download IBM Semeru Runtimes for free]. Semeru integrates well with Liberty (link:https://foojay.io/today/where-do-you-get-your-java/[find out more about Semeru and other Java distributions]).



Please refer to the link for setting up Java: https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/semeru-runtimes-installation

There are multiple Java distributions; find out more in link:https://foojay.io/today/where-do-you-get-your-java/[Where do you get your Java?]

When the Java installation is completed, ensure the `JAVA_HOME` variable has been properly configured in your system path. The `JAVA_HOME` variable is essential for Maven Liberty projects because it indicates which JVM to use. Locate the Java installation path on your system, and then export or set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable using the following command (Linux and Mac):

[role='command']
```
export JAVA_HOME=<your Java installation path>
```

=== Installing Liberty Tools for IDE Enhancement
Liberty Tools is a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA that provides integrated support for Liberty applications. Liberty Tools provides tools to help you to develop, test, debug, and manage applications in IntelliJ.

To install Liberty Tools in IntelliJ IDEA:

1. Start IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Click Plugins or open the Plugins section of the Setting dialog.
3. Search the Plugins Marketplace for `Liberty Tools`. If nothing is found, check whether you have a link:https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14856-liberty-tools[supported version of IntelliJ IDEA].
4. Install Liberty Tools then restart the IDE.

When the IDE restarts, Liberty Tools is installed and enabled.

[#libertyStarter]
== Creating a Liberty Maven project with the Open Liberty Starter

The Open Liberty Starter provides a simple way to create a Liberty Maven project for your Java cloud-native app. The Maven project contains all the files and project structure that you need to get starting writing your app. You can easily modify the project configuration (e.g. in the `pom.xml` and `server.xml`) to add more or different options later if necessary.

To create your project:

1. Visit the link:https://openliberty.io/start/[Open Liberty Starter].
2. Accept the default values by clicking **Generate Project** and download your project.

[#ImportProject]
== Importing your project into IntelliJ IDEA

When using IntelliJ IDEA, you can either navigate to `File` > `Open...` within the IDE or simply drag and drop the project folder into the IDE window for seamless integration.

[#AboutProject]
== Overview of the Liberty Maven project

=== Project structure

A well-organized file structure is crucial for Maven projects, providing a clear framework for development. This hierarchy includes directories for application code, MicroProfile, Liberty configuration and tests.

image::img/blog/liberty-app-directory-img.png[Liberty Project directory image,width=40%,align="center"]

Referring to the demo Maven project's structure shown in the picture: 

- `src/main/java`: Java application code files
- `src/main/liberty/config`: Liberty configuration files
- `src/main/resources/META-INF`: MicroProfile configuration files
- `src/test`: Test files
- `Dockerfile`: Dockerfile for building the Docker image
- `mvnw`/`mvnw.cmd`: Maven Wrapper script for Unix-like/Windows systems


Within the `app-name` directory, the `pom.xml` file containing configuration details for the project, encompassing dependencies, plugins, and other settings.

=== Declaring dependencies
Maven manage the project through the Maven configuration `pom.xml` file. To declare dependencies, `<dependencies>` section should be used. For example:

[source]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>jakarta.platform</groupId>
        <artifactId>jakarta.jakartaee-api</artifactId>
        <version>10.0.0</version>
        <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

In this example, the `jakarta.jakartaee-api` from `jakarta.platform` has been introduced as a dependency for this project. 

For adding or updating dependencies in a Maven project, you can visit the link:https://mvnrepository.com/[Maven Library] for more information.

=== Adding plugins
Plugins enhance the functionality of Maven by providing additional capabilities. Common plugins encompass tasks such as compiling code, running tests, packaging applications, and more. For instance:

[source]
----
<pluginManagement>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
            <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.10.2</version>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</pluginManagement>
----

//explain lmp here
In this example, the `liberty-maven-plugin` from `io.openliberty.tools` has been introduced as a plugin for this project. The Liberty Maven Plugin offers several goals for managing a Liberty runtime, including tasks such as downloading and installing the Liberty runtime, starting or stopping a Liberty server in development mode, installing features, and deploying applications. Please visit link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven/blob/main/README.md[Liberty Maven Plugin Document] for more information.


[#libertyToolsWithDevMode]
== Rapid application development with Liberty Tools

=== Introducing Liberty Tools
Liberty Tools enhances the application development experience with Open Liberty by providing convenient features. It includes a Liberty Dashboard for organizing projects and integrates Liberty dev mode directly into your IDE. 

The Liberty Dashboard effectively manages Maven projects, seamlessly integrating configurations for Open Liberty. Moreover, it facilitates rapid development of MicroProfile and Jakarta EE applications by offering automatic code blocks, auto-complete functionality, and real-time syntax validation. With just a few clicks, you can start or stop your app, run tests, and check reports. 

Furthermore, Liberty dev mode can swiftly apply code changes to your running app without needing to restart the server, ensuring faster development.

You may opt to use Liberty Tools for enhanced convenience:

image::img/blog/Liberty-Tools-Example.png[Liberty Tools Example image, title="An example integrating Liberty Dashboard from Liberty Tools into a Maven project with IntelliJ IDEA", width=30%,align="center"]

Liberty Tools offer three methods to assist you in starting your Liberty application in development mode: Start, Start with configuration, or Start in a container. To start your application in dev mode, click the `Start` action for your application in the Liberty Dashboard.

To effectively use the Liberty Tools for Liberty dev mode and other Liberty dashboard option, consulting the link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/liberty-tools-intellij/blob/main/docs/user-guide.md#run-your-application-on-liberty-using-dev-mode[user guide provided with IntelliJ IDEA] is recommended. For more information about liberty development mode and container support for development mode, please visit the link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/development-mode.html[dev mode document].

You can also visit articles on IBM Developers for More information about Liberty Tools: link:https://developer.ibm.com/articles/awb-effective-cloud-native-development-open-liberty-intellij-idea/[Effective cloud-native Java app development with Open Liberty in IntelliJ IDEA]

Additionally, you can use the command line.

Open a command line session, navigate to the installation directory, and run the following command 

[role='command']
```
./mvnw liberty:dev
```

This will install all required dependencies and start the default server in dev mode. If successful, you will see the necessary features installed and the following messages:

[role='no_copy']
```
[INFO] [AUDIT   ] CWWKF0012I: The server installed the following features: [appAuthentication-3.0, appAuthorization-2.1, appClientSupport-2.0, appSecurity-5.0, batch-2.1, beanValidation-3.0, cdi-4.0, concurrent-3.0, connectors-2.1, distributedMap-1.0, enterpriseBeans-4.0, enterpriseBeansHome-4.0, enterpriseBeansLite-4.0, enterpriseBeansPersistentTimer-4.0 ... ].
[INFO] [AUDIT   ] CWWKF0011I: The defaultServer server is ready to run a smarter planet. The defaultServer server started in 6.514 seconds.
...           
[INFO] ************************************************************************
[INFO] *    Liberty is running in dev mode.

```

[#tryLibertyDevMode]
== Edit your app with Liberty dev mode

Dev mode can automatically detect, recompile, and deploy code changes whenever you save a new change in your IDE or text editor. To try out this feature, an example of creating a simple REST Resource Java File is provided.

Please check out the project and ensure that Liberty dev mode is running. Then, create a new Java class file named `HelloWorldResource.java` as the REST resource.

[source]
```
src/main/java/com/demo/rest/HelloWorldResource.java
```

Paste the following code into the file: 

[source,java]
```
package com.demo.rest;

import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Produces;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

@Path("/hello")
public class HelloWorldResource {

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String helloWorld() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
}
```

When the console displays `Web application available`, the Liberty server has successfully detected, recompiled, and deployed the changes. You can now view the message drafted in the example by accessing the link: http://localhost:9080/app-name/api/hello
