By the end of this blog post, you will be able to create a Liberty Maven project for a new cloud-native Java application by using the Open Liberty Starter, and to edit your application using the Liberty Tools in IntelliJ IDEA:

* <<prerequisites, Before you start>>
* <<libertyStarter, Create a Liberty Maven project with the Open Liberty Starter>>
* <<ImportProject, Import your project into IntelliJ IDEA>>
* <<AboutProject, Explore your Liberty Maven project>>
* <<tryLibertyDevMode, Edit your app using Liberty dev mode>>


[#prerequisites]
== Before you start

=== Installing Java

Install either Java 17 or Java 21. You can link:https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/semeru-runtimes-installation[download IBM Semeru Runtimes for free]. Semeru integrates well with Liberty (link:https://foojay.io/today/where-do-you-get-your-java/[find out more about Semeru and other Java distributions]).





When the Java installation is completed, ensure the `JAVA_HOME` variable has been properly configured in your system path. The `JAVA_HOME` variable is essential for Maven Liberty projects because it indicates which JVM to use. Locate the Java installation path on your system, and then export or set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable using the following command (Linux and Mac):

[role='command']
```
export JAVA_HOME=<your Java installation path>
```

=== Installing Liberty Tools for IDE Enhancement
Liberty Tools is a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA that provides integrated support for Liberty applications. Liberty Tools provides tools to help you to develop, test, debug, and manage applications in IntelliJ.

To install Liberty Tools in IntelliJ IDEA:

1. Start IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Click Plugins or open the Plugins section of the Setting dialog.
3. Search the Plugins Marketplace for `Liberty Tools`. If nothing is found, check whether you have a link:https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14856-liberty-tools[supported version of IntelliJ IDEA].
4. Install Liberty Tools then restart the IDE.

When the IDE restarts, Liberty Tools is installed and enabled.

[#libertyStarter]
== Creating a Liberty Maven project with the Open Liberty Starter

The Open Liberty Starter provides a simple way to create a Liberty Maven project for your Java cloud-native app. The Maven project contains all the files and project structure that you need to get starting writing your app. You can easily modify the project configuration (e.g. in the `pom.xml` and `server.xml`) to add more or different options later if necessary.

To create your project:

1. Visit the link:https://openliberty.io/start/[Open Liberty Starter].
2. Accept the default values by clicking **Generate Project** and download your project.

[#ImportProject]
== Importing your project into IntelliJ IDEA

When you import a Liberty Maven project into IntelliJ IDEA, the Liberty Tools automatically detects the project.

To import your Liberty Maven project:

1. Extract the `app-name.zip` file that you downloaded from the Open Liberty Starter. The file extracts to a project folder called `app-name` which you can optionally move to elsewhere on your file system before continuing.
2. In the IDE, click **File > Open...**, select the project folder, then click **Open**.

Your project is imported into IntelliJ IDEA and detected by Liberty Tools.

[#AboutProject]
== Overview of the Liberty Maven project

=== Project structure

A well-organized file structure is crucial for Maven projects, providing a clear framework for development. This hierarchy includes directories for application code, MicroProfile, Liberty configuration and tests.

image::img/blog/liberty-app-directory-img.png[Liberty Project directory image,width=40%,align="center"]

A well-organized file structure is crucial for Maven projects, providing a clear framework for development. This hierarchy includes directories for application code, MicroProfile, Liberty configuration, and tests:

- `src/main/java`: Java application code files
- `src/main/liberty/config`: Liberty configuration files
- `src/main/resources/META-INF`: MicroProfile configuration files
- `src/test`: Test files
- `Dockerfile`: Dockerfile for building the Docker image
- `mvnw` or `mvnw.cmd`: Maven Wrapper script for Unix-like or Windows operating systems


In the `app-name` directory, the `pom.xml` file contains configuration details for the project, including dependencies, plugins, and other settings.

=== Declaring dependencies
If you need to add any Liberty features (e.g. JPA support) to your app, you need to update the Maven project configuration in the `pom.xml`.

To declare dependencies, edit the `<dependencies>` section of the `pom.xml`. For example:

[source, xml]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>jakarta.platform</groupId>
        <artifactId>jakarta.jakartaee-api</artifactId>
        <version>10.0.0</version>
        <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

In this example, the `jakarta.jakartaee-api` from `jakarta.platform` has been introduced as a dependency for this project. 

For adding or updating dependencies in a Maven project, you can visit the link:https://mvnrepository.com/[Maven Library] for more information.

=== Adding Maven plugins

Like IntelliJ IDEA (and many other development tools), you can enhance the functionality of Maven by adding Maven plugins that provide additional capabilities. Maven plugins that are commonly used include those for compiling code, running tests, and packaging application.

The Liberty Maven Plugin is a Maven plugin that the Open Liberty Starter configured in your Liberty Maven project. The Liberty Maven Plugin provides several goals for managing a Liberty runtime, including tasks such as downloading and installing the Liberty runtime, starting or stopping a Liberty server in development mode, installing features, and deploying applications.

You can see where the Liberty Maven Plugin is configured in your Liberty Maven project in the `pluginManagement` section of the `pom.xml`:

[source, xml]
----
<pluginManagement>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
            <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.10.2</version>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</pluginManagement>
----

//explain lmp here
In this example, the `liberty-maven-plugin` from `io.openliberty.tools` has been added to this project. 

For more information about the Liberty Maven Plugin, see the link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven/blob/main/README.md[Liberty Maven Plugin docs].


[#libertyToolsWithDevMode]
== Efficiently edit your application with Liberty dev mode

Liberty Tools enhances the application development experience with Open Liberty by providing convenient features, which include the Liberty Dashboard for organizing projects and Liberty dev mode integrated directly into your IDE. 

The Liberty Dashboard effectively manages Maven projects, seamlessly integrating configurations for Open Liberty. It facilitates rapid development of MicroProfile and Jakarta EE applications by offering automatic code blocks, auto-complete functionality, and real-time syntax validation. With just a few clicks, you can start or stop your app, run tests, and check reports. 

Liberty dev mode can swiftly apply code changes to your running app without needing to restart the server, ensuring faster development.

Click the Open Liberty logo on the right-side of the IDE window to open the Liberty tool window, which provides a set of actions to help you to manage your app (e.g. starting and stopping the Liberty runtime instance):

image::img/blog/Liberty-Tools-Example.png[Liberty Tools Example image, title="An example integrating Liberty Dashboard from Liberty Tools into a Maven project with IntelliJ IDEA", width=30%,align="center"]

Liberty Tools offer three ways of starting your Liberty application in dev mode: Start, Start with configuration, or Start in a container.

For now, click the **Start** action to simply start your application in dev mode.

To effectively use the Liberty Tools for Liberty dev mode and other Liberty dashboard option, consulting the link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/liberty-tools-intellij/blob/main/docs/user-guide.md#run-your-application-on-liberty-using-dev-mode[user guide provided with IntelliJ IDEA] is recommended. For more information about liberty development mode and container support for development mode, please visit the link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/development-mode.html[dev mode document].

You can also visit articles on IBM Developers for More information about Liberty Tools: link:https://developer.ibm.com/articles/awb-effective-cloud-native-development-open-liberty-intellij-idea/[Effective cloud-native Java app development with Open Liberty in IntelliJ IDEA]

Additionally, you can use the command line.

Open a command line session, navigate to the installation directory, and run the following command 

[role='command']
```
./mvnw liberty:dev
```

This will install all required dependencies and start the default server in dev mode. If successful, you will see the necessary features installed and the following messages:

[role='no_copy']
```
[INFO] [AUDIT   ] CWWKF0012I: The server installed the following features: [appAuthentication-3.0, appAuthorization-2.1, appClientSupport-2.0, appSecurity-5.0, batch-2.1, beanValidation-3.0, cdi-4.0, concurrent-3.0, connectors-2.1, distributedMap-1.0, enterpriseBeans-4.0, enterpriseBeansHome-4.0, enterpriseBeansLite-4.0, enterpriseBeansPersistentTimer-4.0 ... ].
[INFO] [AUDIT   ] CWWKF0011I: The defaultServer server is ready to run a smarter planet. The defaultServer server started in 6.514 seconds.
...           
[INFO] ************************************************************************
[INFO] *    Liberty is running in dev mode.

[INFO] Source compilation was successful.
```

[#tryLibertyDevMode]
== Edit your app with Liberty dev mode

Dev mode can automatically detect, recompile, and deploy code changes whenever you save a new change in your IDE or text editor. To try out this feature, an example of creating a simple REST Resource Java File is provided.

Please check out the project and ensure that Liberty dev mode is running. Then, create a new Java class file named `HelloWorldResource.java` as the REST resource.

[source]
```
src/main/java/com/demo/rest/HelloWorldResource.java
```

Paste the following code into the file: 

[source,java]
```
package com.demo.rest;

import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Produces;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

@Path("/hello")
public class HelloWorldResource {

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String helloWorld() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
}
```

When the console displays `Web application available`, the Liberty server has successfully detected, recompiled, and deployed the changes. You can now view the message drafted in the example by accessing the link: http://localhost:9080/app-name/api/hello
