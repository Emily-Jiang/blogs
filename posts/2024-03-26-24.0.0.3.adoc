// "open-graph-image" is set to OL logo. Whenever possible update this to a more appropriate/specific image (For example if present a image that is being used in the post). However, it

2. Which Liberty feature(s) does your update relate to?

    Users debugging performance or OutOfMemoryError issues.
   
   </GHA-BLOG-TARGET-PERSONA>

   <GHA-BLOG-SUMMARY>
4. Provide a summary of the update, including the following points:
   
   - A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.
   
If you are using IBM Java/Semeru, verbose garbage collection logging will be enabled by default. There will now be an extra rolling log file in your logs directory with the name `verbosegc.001.log`. 

   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)
   
By default, verbosegc is not enabled in Liberty (specifically, not enabled by default in Java). This is a problem if a performance or OutOfMemoryError issue occurs as the issue will often need to be reproduced with verbosegc, or users may simply overlook garbage collection performance issues.

   - Briefly explain how to make your update work. Include screenshots, diagrams, and/or code snippets, and provide a `server.xml` snippet.
   
Its a default, so theres nothing extra needed to make the update work. Using a server command will activate verbose garbage collection logging, creating a rolling log file (up to 10 files, 1024 GC cycles per file).

   - Where can they find out more about this specific update (eg Open Liberty docs, Javadoc) and/or the wider technology?

As part of  
```
https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/pull/9177/files#diff-2de04da34f7e35c085ca26dc596410983f5ded55a8de11eb97811264dea011f2
```
the grpc-java developers removed the flush from the last frame of the stream as their code
stack always flushed as part of sending trailers which comes next. The OpenLiberty code stack did not match 
this exactly and this led to occasional EOS errors, seen during the gRPC upgrade
to the open source grpc-java jar level that contains that commit referenced above.
+
So as part of the gRPC-java upgrade, a patch was put in to 'undo' the google flag change
local to the reciever of the flag underneath to where it was done. (See the deleted code
in the associated PR 27520.
+
Unfortunately, this patch suffered from a race condition that meant that occasionally, as part of the
batch regression testing, errors related to unexpected end of stream errors were seen and these
were not seen during the initial development and release testing.
+
This is an intermittent error that manifests typically as:
```
 java.io.IOException: com.ibm.ws.http2.upgrade.H2Exception: stream was already closed!
with the following message
RVE8055E: An unexpected exception occurred flushing out the rest of the response data.
```
When using gRPC server code.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/26195[mpHealth-2.2 responds with a status UP briefly during startup]
+
mpHealth-2.2 Readiness check (at /health/ready) responds with a 200 {"checks":[], "status": "UP"} for a brief time during startup. Around 40 seconds of connection refused, A second or two of this 200/UP response, and then back to 503/Down responses. The brief UP status return is causing Kubernetes to think the application has finished starting up when it has not. It then calls the liveness/readiness probes which have a much shorter failure threshold and causes the pod to be restarted.
+
A stack trace will be provided to Prashanth via Slack as requested with "com.ibm.ws.logging.trace.specification=*=info:HEALTH=all" tracing enabled.

== New and updated guides since the previous release
As Open Liberty features and functionality continue to grow, we continue to add link:https://openliberty.io/guides/?search=new&key=tag[new guides to openliberty.io] on those topics to make their adoption as easy as possible.  Existing guides also receive updates to address any reported bugs/issues, keep their content current, and expand what their topic covers.
