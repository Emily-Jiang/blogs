[#metrics]
== Send Liberty metrics to OpenTelemetry

MicroProfile Telemetry 2.0 provides the latest OpenTelemetry technology. In addition to link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/microprofile-telemetry.html[distributed tracing], the feature now allows OpenTelemetry to collect and export metrics and logs.

When the MicroProfile Telemetry 2.0 feature (`mpTelemetry-2.0`) is enabled, Open Liberty can now forward runtime component statistics that are captured by the link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/feature/monitor-1.0.html[Performance Monitoring 1.0] feature (`monitor-1.0`) to the MicroProfile Telemetry 2.0 runtime. This statistical data is registered as metrics in the telemetry runtime and can then be forwarded to any OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) compatible metric consumer to meet your monitoring needs.

The following runtime components are supported:

* `ThreadPool`
* `Sessions`
* `RequestTiming`
* `ConnectionPool`

To collect and export metrics, enable OpenTelemetry by using the following system property or environment variable:

* System property: `otel.sdk.disabled=false`
* Environment variable: `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=false`

You can set configuration properties in any of the link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/external-configuration.html#default[config sources that are available to MicroProfile Config].


Enable the `mpTelemetry-2.0` feature and any features that are associated with your chosen supported runtime components. The `mpTelemetry-2.0` feature automatically enables the `monitor-1.0` feature.

For example, the `ConnectionPool` component requires the following configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<featureManager>
   <feature>mpTelemetry-2.0</feature>
   <feature>jdbc-4.3</feature>
</featureManager>
----


By default, all OpenTelemetry data is exported to link:https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/java/exporters/#otlp[OTLP]. You can set a different exporter by specifying the following system property or environment variable:

* System property: `otel.metrics.exporter`
* Environment variable: `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER`

You can also optionally configure the metric export interval configuration variable. The value is specified in milliseconds and the default is 60000 (60 seconds).

* System property: `otel.metric.export.interval`
* Environment variable: `OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_INTERVAL`

[#logs]
== Send logs to OpenTelemetry

The `mpTelemetry-2.0` feature can now collect Open Liberty runtime log sources (messages, traces, ffdcs) and application logs generated through the `java.util.logging` package (JUL).

To enable the MicroProfile Telemetry 2.0 feature to collect all logs, add the following configuration to your `server.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<features>
   <feature>mpTelemetry-2.0</feature>
</features>

<mpTelemetry source="message, trace, ffdc"/>
----

If the `mpTelemetry` configuration element or the `source` attribute is not configured, the `message` source is set by default. In this case, only messages are collected. If the `source` attribute is specified empty (`source=""`), no logs are sent to OpenTelemetry.

To collect and export runtime-level logs, enable OpenTelemetry by using the following system property or environment variable:

* System property: `otel.sdk.disabled=false`
* Environment variable: `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=false`

You can set configuration properties in any of the link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/external-configuration.html#default[config sources that are available to MicroProfile Config].

To separately configure multiple applications in a server, you can configure OpenTelemetry with application configuration. However, you cannot collect runtime-level logs this way.

By default, all OpenTelemetry data is exported to link:https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/java/exporters/#otlp[OTLP]. You can set a different exporter by specifying the following system property or environment variable:

* System property: `otel.logs.exporter`
* Environment variable: `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER`

For more information about the available configuration properties, see xref:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/microprofile-config-properties.html#telemetry[MicroProfile Config properties: MicroProfile Telemetry].

[#cookie]
== Keep using third-party cookies with CHIPS

To increase privacy and reduce tracking, link:https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/3pcd/[Google Chrome announced it would phase out third-party cookies in 2025]. Then, as of July 22, 2024, link:https://privacysandbox.com/news/privacy-sandbox-update/[Chrome stated they might scrap the phase-out plan] due to regulatory concerns. Users could instead opt to block third-party cookies via their browser. Some sites that are designed with third-party cookies in mind are broken by browsers that opt-in to block third-party cookies. Chrome provides link:https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/3pcd/prepare/test-for-breakage[documentation] to help you test whether your sites are affected. If you are, one option to mitigate this change is called CHIPS: Cookies Having Independent Partitioned State.

First, some background information regarding third-party (cross-site) cookies.

If a top-level site X embeds another site Z, such as an iframe, then any cookies set by the embedded site Z might be shared with any other site that embeds site Z, such as top-level site Y. This vulnerability is due to cookies placed in a cookie jar under the Z site key. This scenario assumes that the cookie is labeled as `SameSite=None`, because it isn't shared when set to `Lax` or `Strict`.

image::/img/blog/cookie1.png[multisite cookie diagram,width=70%,align="center"]


Chrome provides a `Partitioned` cookie attribute, which divides the cookie jar, as a workaround for third-party cookies with limitations. Instead of saving the cookies within the Z site key, they are also keyed under the top-level site, such as X and Y.  In this way, if X embeds Z and Y embeds Z, the Z's cookies will not be shared between X and Y.

image::/img/blog/cookie2.png[partitioned cookie diagram,width=70%,align="center"]

You can use the `Partitioned` attribute to specify whether a cookie is partitioned. If the `SameSite=None` attribute is missing from the cookie, it is blocked by Chrome and any Chromium-based browsers because it is treated as `Lax`.

The partitioned attribute configuration is opt-in and behaves much like the SameSite configuration. The `samesite` channel configuration applies to all cookies, while the `httpSession` and `webAppSecurity` configurations apply to their respective cookies. It's important to note that the `httpSession` and `webAppSecurity` configurations take precedence over the channel configuration. The default value for these two attributes is `defer`, which means they defer to the channel configuration. As for channel configuration, its default value is `false`, which means the `Partitioned` attribute is not added.

Depending on which configuration you use to declare the `Partitioned` attribute, Liberty uses one of three attributes.

The following example shows how to set the `cookiePartitioned` attribute for the HTTP session cookie on the `httpSession` attribute in your `server.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<httpSession cookieSameSite="None" cookiePartitioned="defer|true|false"/>`
----

The following example shows how to set the `partitionedCookie` attribute for LTPA and JWT security cookies on the `webAppSecurity` attribute in your `server.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<webAppSecurity sameSiteCookie="None" partitionedCookie="defer|true|false"/>`
----

The following example shows how to set the `partitioned` attribute for other cookies on the `httpEndpoint` attribute in your `server.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<httpEndpoint id="defaultHttpEndpoint"
              httpPort="9080"
              httpsPort="9443" >
   <samesite none="*" partitioned="true|false"/>
</httpEndpoint>
----


Alternatively, you can set `Partitioned` by using the `Set-Cookie` header with the following two `HttpServletResponse` APIs:

* link:https://openliberty.io/docs/ref/javaee/8/#package=javax/servlet/http/package-frame.html&class=javax/servlet/http/HttpServletResponse.html#setHeader-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-[HttpServletResponse.setHeader]
* link:https://openliberty.io/docs/ref/javaee/8/#package=javax/servlet/http/package-frame.html&class=javax/servlet/http/HttpServletResponse.html#addHeader-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-[HttpServletResponse.addHeader]

[#versionless]
== Versionless features for Java / Jakarta EE Container Liberty features

In 24.0.0.8, Open Liberty introduced versionless Java EE and Jakarta EE features.  Those new versionless features allow you to easily use features without needing to know what feature version to use.

In 24.0.0.8, the versionless features did not include the `Container` features, which enable you to provide your own implementation of that Java EE or Jakarta EE component specification.  An example of such a feature is `facesContainer-4.0`.

In 24.0.0.9, Open Liberty adds versionless features for the missing `Container` features. The following versionless features are added:

- `jpaContainer` / `persistenceContainer`
- `jsfContainer` / `facesContainer`
- `jsonbContainer`
- `jspContainer`

The following `server.xml` configuration file uses the Java EE platform `javaee-8.0` with versionless features `jpaContainer`, `jsfContainer`, `jsonbContainer`, and `jsonpContainer`:

[source,xml]
----
    <!-- Enable features -->
    <featureManager>
        <platform>javaee-8.0</platform>
        <feature>jpaContainer</feature>
        <feature>jsfContainer</feature>
        <feature>jsonbContainer</feature>
        <feature>jsonpContainer</feature>
    </featureManager>
----

Learn more and check out the full collection of available platforms and versionless features in the link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/feature/versionless-features.html[Open Liberty docs]. Stay tuned for more versionless features and platforms in future releases.
