Open Liberty's support for Spring Boot 3.0 means that you can use Spring Boot 3.x capabilities in your Liberty applications. You can also now authenticate your OpenID Connect clients using the Private Key method instead of client secrets. If you use LTPA/JWT cookies, you can now use different cookies for different applications according to their context root.

And finally: Happy birthday, Open Liberty! 6 years old today (see link:{url-prefix}/blog/2022/09/21/history-maker-projects.html[our history in maker projects]).

// Replace the TAG_X with a short label for the feature in lower-case, eg: mp3
// Replace the FEATURE_1_HEADING with heading the feature section, eg: MicroProfile 3.3
// Where the updates are grouped as sub-headings under a single heading

[#sb3]
== Spring Boot 3.0 support

The Liberty Spring Boot Support 3.0 feature provides more complete support for running a Spring Boot 3.0 application on Liberty. It also provides the capability to "thin" the application when you create applications in containers. 

Prior releases of Liberty provided support for Spring Boot 1.5 and Spring Boot 2.0 applications.  Liberty has also supported Spring Boot applications packaged as a WAR file, as demonstrated in link:https://openliberty.io/blog/2023/06/15/running-spring-boot-3.html[this recent blog post].  The Open Liberty 23.0.0.8-beta release enables you to deploy Spring Boot 3.x applications by enabling the `springboot-3.0` feature, with support for both JAR and WAR file types.

To run a Spring Boot 3.x application on Liberty, you must be running with Java 17 or higher.  Additionally, if your application uses the link:/docs/latest/reference/feature/servlet.html[Jakarta Servlet] feature, it must be Jakarta Servet 6.0. Configure these features in the `server.xml` file, as shown in the following example:

[source,xml]
----
<features>
   <feature>springboot-3.0</feature>
   <feature>servlet-6.0</feature>
</features>
----

As with previous versions of the Spring Boot Support feature, Spring Boot application JAR files can be placed in the `/dropins/spring/` directory.  Alternatively, specify the link:/docs/latest/reference/config/springBootApplication.html[Spring Boot configuration elements] in the `server.xml` file. For example:

[source,xml]
----
 <springBootApplication id="spring-boot-app" location="spring-boot-app-0.1.0.jar" name="spring-boot-app" />
----

If you have used previous versions of the Spring Boot Support feature and are now migrating your application to use Spring Boot 3, note the following requirements:

* link:/docs/latest/reference/feature/webProfile-10.0.html[Jakarta EE 10 features] must be used. 

* Security configuration requires in-application modifications. 
  - link:https://spring.io/blog/2022/02/21/spring-security-without-the-websecurityconfigureradapter[Spring Security without the WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter]

  - link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/authorization/authorize-http-requests.html[Authorize HttpServletRequests]

* A new server template (`springBoot3`) is available.

[#jwt]
== Private Key JWT authentication support for OIDC clients

OpenID Connect clients in Liberty now support the `private_key_jwt` client authentication method with OpenID Connect token endpoints.

OpenID Connect clients are required to provide authentication data to the OpenID Connect provider when they invoke the provider’s token endpoint.
Clients can authenticate using several different methods, but most of those methods require a client secret.
The `private_key_jwt` authentication method enables clients to use asymmetric keys to create signed JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to authenticate instead of client secrets.
OpenID Connect clients using this authentication method are no longer required to have a client secret.

Enable this capability in your client application using the `private_key_jwt` option for the `tokenEndpointAuthMethod` attribute, and the `tokenEndpointAuthSigningAlgorithm` and `keyAliasName` attributes in either the `openidConnectClient` or `oidcLogin` elements in the client's `server.xml` file.

For example, when you use the OpenID Connect Client feature, include the following configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<featureManager>
   <feature>openidConnectClient-1.0</feature>
</featureManager>
    ...
<openidConnectClient tokenEndpointAuthMethod="private_key_jwt" keyAliasName="privateKeyJwtAliasRS512" ... />
----

For example, if you are using the Social Media Login feature, include the following configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<featureManager>
    <feature>socialLogin-1.0</feature>
</featureManager>
...
<oidcLogin tokenEndpointAuthMethod="private_key_jwt" tokenEndpointAuthSigningAlgorithm="E512" keyAliasName="privateKeyJwtAliasES512" ... />
----

The `tokenEndpointAuthSigningAlgorithm` attribute specifies the signing algorithm to sign the JWT that is used for client authentication. The `keyAliasName` attribute points to the key to use to sign the JWT, and must also be the alias for the public key that corresponds to the private key. The private key must be in the keystore that is specified by the SSL configuration that is referenced by `sslRef` in the OIDC client configuration. The public key must be in one of the following locations:

* the truststore that is specified by the `trustStoreRef` attribute
* the truststore that is specified by the SSL configuration that is referenced by `sslRef`
* the keystore that is specified by the SSL configuration that is referenced by `sslRef`

For more information about the configuration options, see the docs:

* link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/config/openidConnectClient.html[openidConnectClient element]
* link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/config/oidcLogin.html[oidcLogin element]

For more information about JWT authentication, see:

* link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication[OpenID Connect core specification]
* link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7523[RFC 7523]

[#cookie]
== Use different LTPA/JWT cookies for different applications

The SSO LTPA/JWT cookies always had the cookie path set to `/`. You can now set the SSO LTPA/JWT cookie path to the application's context root. This enables you to use different SSO LTPA/JWT tokens for different applications.

Enable the `useContextRootForSSOCookiePath` attribute in the `webAppSecurity` element. For example, add the following line to the `server.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<webAppSecurity useContextRootForSSOCookiePath="true"/> 
----
