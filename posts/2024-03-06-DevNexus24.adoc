== What is DevNexus?
link:https://devnexus.com/[DevNexus] is the longest-running and largest Java Conference in the US. It’s organised by a vibrant Java community who are passionate about enabling education for all and empowering the Java developer community. Last year's event brought more than 1400 developers together from all over the world, and more than 90 speakers shared their knowledge on exciting, trending topics like software architecture, core Java, Kubernetes, and security.

You can see more of the 2023 highlights in this promo link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2pYHLx70rQ[video]. For those of you who are keen eyed, you might even spot our very own link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/space-rover-mission#readme[Liberty Space Rover]!


This year the event is being held in downtown Atlanta at the Georgia World Congress Center from April 9th-11th and tickets are already sold out! It's sure to be an awesome event, with 145 international speakers taking the stage.


== Open Liberty Booth at DevNexus

This year we are excited to have our very own Open Liberty booth as well as having members of the Open Liberty team on site hosting sessions, quick labs, workshops, and running demonstrations at the IBM and MicroProfile booths. 

We're honoured to have a booth alongside other open source projects like MicroProfile and PostgresSQL. Having our own booth gives attendees the opportunity to come and meet the people behind the technology and offers the chance to ask questions and learn more about these amazing open source projects!

So, if you're coming to DevNexus, be sure to pop by our Open Liberty booth in the breaks and say hi. You may even get some cool Open Liberty swag!


== Which session should I attend?

The great part about attending a conference like DevNexus is the huge array of topics, sessions and speakers presenting throughout the event. You have the chance to learn about everything from agile, architecture and AI, through to cloud infrastructure, cloud technologies and core Java/Jakarta EE. But with over 140 different sessions to choose from, and up to 13 sessions all occurring at the same time, how do you choose which sessions to attend?!

Deciding which sessions to see can be a real challenge! But to help make this easier, we’ve put together this guide of the sessions available on each day focused on open source, cloud-native Java technologies, including: Open Liberty, MicroProfile, Jakarta EE, and more. 
There's also a dedicated Jakarta EE track this year, so make sure to check out those sessions.
