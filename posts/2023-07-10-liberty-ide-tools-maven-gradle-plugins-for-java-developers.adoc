//Blank line here is necessary before starting the body of the post.

// // // // // // // //
// In the preceding section:
// Do not insert any blank lines between any of the lines.
//
// "open-graph-image" is set to OL logo. Whenever possible update this to a more appropriate/specific image (For example if present a image that is being used in the post). However, it
// can be left empty which will set it to the default
//
// "open-graph-image-alt" is a description of what is in the image (not a caption). When changing "open-graph-image" to
// a custom picture, you must provide a custom string for "open-graph-image-alt".
//
// Replace TITLE with the blog post title.
// Replace AUTHOR_NAME with your name as first author.
// Replace GITHUB_USERNAME with your GitHub username eg: lauracowen
// Replace DESCRIPTION with a short summary (~60 words) of the release (a more succinct version of the first paragraph of the post).
//
// Replace AUTHOR_NAME with your name as you'd like it to be displayed, eg: Laura Cowen
//
// Example post: 2020-04-02-generate-microprofile-rest-client-code.adoc
//
// If adding image into the post add :
// -------------------------
// [.img_border_light]
// image::img/blog/FILE_NAME[IMAGE CAPTION ,width=70%,align="center"]
// -------------------------
// "[.img_border_light]" = This adds a faint grey border around the image to make its edges sharper. Use it around screenshots but not           
// around diagrams. Then double check how it looks.
// There is also a "[.img_border_dark]" class which tends to work best with screenshots that are taken on dark backgrounds.
// Change "FILE_NAME" to the name of the image file. Also make sure to put the image into the right folder which is: img/blog
// change the "IMAGE CAPTION" to a couple words of what the image is
// // // // // // // //

== Fast iterative development with Liberty Tools

Liberty Tools 23.0.6 are now available for use by Java developers to build cloud-native applications with Liberty.

Liberty Tools support popular integrated development environments (IDEs) such as Eclipse IDE, Visual Studio Code, and IntelliJ IDEA, allowing developers to focus on their code and rapidly iterate by using Liberty's link:/docs/latest/development-mode.html[dev mode] in their preferred IDE. Moreover, Liberty Tools provide editing assistance for developers to easily make changes to the Liberty configuration files, and coding assistance for writing applications using Jakarta EE (9.x and later) and MicroProfile (3.x and later) APIs.

Learn more about link:/docs/latest/develop-liberty-tools.html[Liberty Tools] and download them from different IDE marketplaces:
