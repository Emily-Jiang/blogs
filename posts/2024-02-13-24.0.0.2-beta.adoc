   - A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.

   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)
   
   - Briefly explain how to make your update work. Include screenshots, diagrams, and/or code snippets, and provide a `server.xml` snippet.
   
   - Where can they find out more about this specific update (eg Open Liberty docs, Javadoc) and/or the wider technology?  
    
OpenID Connect clients and servers in Open Liberty now support back-channel logout. Back-channel logout allows OpenID Connect servers to directly notify OpenID Connect clients of a user logout so a local logout can also be performed for that user in each OpenID Connect client. Previously, OpenID Connect servers were only able to notify OpenID Connect clients that a user logged out by using iframes embedded in the OpenID Connect client's web page. This meant that a web page must be active for this communication to occur or else the OpenID Connect client would not be notified of the logout that occurred at the OpenID Connect server. Back-channel logout solves this problem through direct communication between the OpenID Connect server and clients.

With this release, back-channel logout is enabled by default when the OpenID Connect Client and Social Media Login features are used. The back-channel logout endpoints can be found at `/oidcclient/backchannel_logout/{clientId}` and `/ibm/api/social-login/backchannel_logout/{clientId}` for those features respectively.

To enable back-channel logout for OpenID Connect servers, the OpenID Connect client's back-channel logout URI must be specified when dynamically registering the OAuth client by using the `backchannel_logout_uri` metadata value, or by using the `backchannelLogoutUri` attribute for OAuth clients defined in a `localStore`. Additionally, the OpenID Connect server will wait a default of 180 seconds before the back-channel logout request times out, but this duration can also be specified using the `backchannelLogoutRequestTimeout` attribute. An example `server.xml` is shown here demonstrating how to specify the back-channel logout URI that an OpenID Connect server should use to make back-channel logout requests with a timeout of 60 seconds.

```
<featureManager>
    <feature>openidConnectServer-1.0</feature>
</featureManager>

...

<openidConnectProvider 
    id="OidcConfigSample" 
    backchannelLogoutRequestTimeout="60s"
    oauthProviderRef="OAuthConfigSample" ... />

<oauthProvider id="OAuthConfigSample" ... >
    <localStore>
        <client 
            name="client01"
            backchannelLogoutUri="http://localhost:9080/oidcclient/backchannel_logout/client01" 
            ... />
    </localStore>
</oauthProvider>
```

Now, when the OpenID Connect server's logout or end_session endpoint is invoked, the OpenID Connect server will also send back-channel logout requests to log the user out at the OpenID Connect clients as well. The OpenID Connect server's logout endpoint can be found at `/oidc/endpoint/{oidcProviderId}/logout` and the end_session endpoint can be found at `/oidc/endpoint/{oidcProviderId}/end_session`. Optionally, an `id_token_hint` containing an ID Token issued by that OpenID Connect server can be added to the endpoint request as a query parameter to help determine the user to log out. This is useful in scenarios where the logout or end_session request is made without the user's OpenID Connect server SSO cookie. Additionally, if the OpenID Connect server is configured with a SAML Identity Provider, a logout at the SAML Identity Provider will also trigger the OpenID Connect server to send back-channel logout requests to the OpenID Connect clients.

To enable the new beta features in your app, add them to your `server.xml`:

[source, xml]
----

----

[#run]
=== Try it now 

To try out these features, update your build tools to pull the Open Liberty All Beta Features package instead of the main release. The beta works with Java SE XX, Java SE 17, Java SE 11, and Java SE 8.
// // // // // // // //
// In the preceding section:
// Check if a new non-LTS Java SE version is supported that needs to be added to the list (17, 11, and 8 are LTS and will remain for a while)
// https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/java-se.html
// // // // // // // //

If you're using link:{url-prefix}/guides/maven-intro.html[Maven], you can install the All Beta Features package using:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.8.2</version>
    <configuration>
        <runtimeArtifact>
          <groupId>io.openliberty.beta</groupId>
          <artifactId>openliberty-runtime</artifactId>
          <version>24.0.0.2-beta</version>
          <type>zip</type>
        </runtimeArtifact>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

You must also add dependencies to your pom.xml file for the beta version of the APIs that are associated with the beta features that you want to try.  For example, for Jakarta EE 10 and MicroProfile 6, you would include:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.microprofile</groupId>
    <artifactId>microprofile</artifactId>
    <version>6.0-RC3</version>
    <type>pom</type>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.platform</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.jakartaee-api</artifactId>
    <version>10.0.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----

Or for link:{url-prefix}/guides/gradle-intro.html[Gradle]:

[source,gradle]

buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()

    dependencies {

    }
}
apply plugin: 'liberty'
dependencies {
    libertyRuntime group: 'io.openliberty.beta', name: 'openliberty-runtime', version: '[24.0.0.2-beta,)'
}

// // // // // // // //
// In the preceding section:
// Replace the Maven `3.8.2` with the latest version of the plugin: https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.openliberty.tools/liberty-maven-plugin
// Replace the Gradle `3.6.2` with the latest version of the plugin: https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.openliberty.tools/liberty-gradle-plugin
// TODO: Update GHA to automatically do the above.  If the maven.org is problematic, then could fallback to using the GH Releases for the plugins
