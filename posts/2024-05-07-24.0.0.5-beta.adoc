[#SUB_TAG_0]
== Jakarta CDI 4.1

CDI allows objects to be bound to lifecycle contexts, to be injected, to be associated with interceptors and decorators, and to interact in a loosely coupled fashion by firing and observing events. Highlights of CDI 4.1 include the ability for interceptors to inspect the annotations used to bind them. This update also brings in new Jakarta EE 11 versions of the Jakarta Annotations and Jakarta Interceptors APIs.

=== Retrieve interceptor binding info

Support has been added to allow interceptors to retrieve and inspect the annotations used to bind them. Interceptors can now call [`InvocationContext.getInterceptorBindings()`][get-bindings] or one of the related methods to retrieve the annotations so that they can read values from them. This is particularly useful when some of the fields of an interceptor binding annotation are annotated with `@Nonbinding`. These fields are not used to restrict which interceptor is bound and can now be read by the interceptor when  the interceptor method is called.

For example, a binding annotation for a logging interceptor could look like this:

[source,java]
----
@InterceptorBinding
public @interface Logged {
    @Nonbinding String value();
}
----

This annotation could be applied to a method on a managed bean like this:
[source,java]
----
@Logged("myName")
public void myMethod() {
   // ....
}
----

Then an interceptor like this could read the value `"myName"` from the annotation and include it in the log message:
[source,java]
----
@Interceptor
@Logged("")
public class LoggedInterceptor {

    private static final Logger LOG = Logger.getLogger(LoggedInterceptor.class.getName());

    @AroundInvoke
    public Object intercept(InvocationContext ctx) throws Exception {
        Logged binding = ctx.getInterceptorBinding(Logged.class);
        LOG.info("Method called: " + binding.value());
        return ctx.proceed();
    }
}
----

The new methods added to [`InvocationContext`][invocationContext] make it easier to retrieve the annotations and will return the correct binding annotations whether they're applied to the class or the method and will reflect any changes made to the annotations by a CDI extension.

=== Invoker support

Support has been added for extensions to create `Invoker`s which are used to call a method on a CDI managed bean indirectly and can support looking up the object instance and the method arguments from CDI. This feature is intended for people who want to build frameworks which build on or integrate with CDI.

More information on how to create and use an `Invoker` can be found on the CDI spec blog.

=== Deprecated methods in BeanManager

`BeanManager.getELResolver` and `BeanManager.wrapExpressionFactory` have been deprecated and will be removed in the next major version so that the CDI API won't need to depend on the Expression Language API. The same methods have been added to `ELAwareBeanManager` which extends `BeanManager` and lives in a new API jar.

These methods were mostly used by EL implementations, but any users who wish to continue using these methods will have to switch to using `ELAwareBeanManager` and include the new API artifact in their dependencies. e.g. by adding it to their maven pom.xml:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.enterprise</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.enterprise.cdi-el-api</artifactId>
    <scope>provided</provided>
    <version>4.1.0</version>
</dependency>
----

NOTE: in this beta, `ELAwareBeanManager` cannot be injected directly, but a `BeanManager` can be injected and then cast to an `ELAwareBeanManager`. This will be fixed before release.

=== Remove references to Managed Beans specification

Jakarta EE 11 will not include the Managed Beans specification (which was separate from the CDI specification but did many of the same things) and so the associated `@ManagedBean` annotation is removed from the Jakarta Annotations API.

=== Changes to EE integration

The parts of the CDI specification which define how CDI integrates with other Jakarta EE technologies have been moved from the CDI specification into the Jakarta EE 11 Platform, Web Profile and Core Profile specifications. This has no effect on end users, but if you use the [CDI specification][cdi-spec] as a documentation reference, you will find that some parts of it are now in the [Plaform][platform-spec], [Web Profile][web-profile-spec] and [Core Profile][core-profile-spec] specifications instead.

To use the CDI 4.1 feature, add `cdi-4.1` to your `server.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<featureManager>
  <feature>cdi-4.0</feature>
</featureManager>

   - Where can they find out more about this specific update (eg Open Liberty docs, Javadoc) and/or the wider technology?

  Jakarta Concurrency allows applications to make use of concurrency while maintaining the benefits of running on a Jakarta EE runtime. Jakarta Concurrency 3.1 is the new version for the upcoming Jakarta EE 11, and it adds support for new features of the latest Java SE releases as well as some usability improvements.

The new features in Jakarta Concurrency 3.1 are improved support for the Java Flow (Reactive Streams) APIs, and the use of Virtual Threads in `ManagedExecutors` and `ManagedThreadFactories`. There is also new support for using `@Inject` in place of `@Resource`, and the option to run asynchronous methods on a schedule using the new `@Schedule` annotation.

To support the Flow APIs, `ContextService` has two new methods, `contextualSubscriber` and `contextualProcessor`, which provides context in a `Flow.Subscriber` and `Flow.Processor` respectively. These new methods allow for context in a Flow when using a `Flow.Publisher` which does not allow configuring a `ManagedExecutor`.

[source,java]
----
publisher.subscribe(contextService.contextualSubscriber(subscriber));
----

Virtual threads are available in Jakarta Concurrency 3.1 by specifying âvirtual = trueâ on a `ManagedExecutorDefinition`, `ManagedScheduledExecutorDefinition` or `ManagedThreadFactory`. Virtual threads are a new feature of Java 21, so when running on Java 17 if âvirtual = trueâ is specified, platform threads will be provided instead of virtual threads.[source,java]
----@ManagedExecutorDefinition(name = "java:module/concurrent/virtual-executor",
                           virtual = true)
----The new `@Schedule` annotation allows asynchronous methods to run on a schedule. In this example, after the method is called, it will run asynchronously on a schedule set by the provided cron string

[source,java]
----
@Asynchronous(runAt = { @Schedule(cron = "*/3 * * * * *")})
void scheduledMethod() {
----

[#SUB_TAG_3]
== Preview of Jakarta Data (Milestone 4)

Jakarta Data is a new Jakarta EE specification being developed in the open that aims to standardize the popular Data Repository pattern across a variety of providers. Open Liberty includes the Jakarta Data 1.0 Milestone 4 release, which adds the Jakarta Data Query Language (JDQL) and enhances the Static Metamodel. The Open Liberty beta includes a test implementation of Jakarta Data that we are using to experiment with proposed specification features so that developers can try out these features and provide feedback to influence the Jakarta Data 1.0 specification as it continues to be developed. The test implementation currently works with relational databases and operates by redirecting repository operations to the built-in Jakarta Persistence provider.

Jakarta Data 1.0 Milestone 4 introduces Jakarta Data Query Language (JDQL), which is a subset of Jakarta Persistence Query Language (JPQL). JDQL allows basic comparison and update operations on a single entity (an entity identifier variable is not used), as well as the ability to perform deletion. Find operations in JDQL consist of SELECT, FROM, WHERE, and ORDER BY clauses, all of which are optional. The Static Metamodel, which allows for more type-safe usage, is simplified in Milestone 4 to allow all fields to be pre-initialized. To use these capabilities, you will need an Entity and a Repository.

Start by defining an entity class that corresponds to your data. With relational databases, the entity class corresponds to a database table and the entity properties (public methods and fields of the entity class) generally correspond to the columns of the table. An entity class can be:

- annotated with `jakarta.persistence.Entity` and related annotations from Jakarta Persistence
- a Java class without entity annotations, in which case the primary key is inferred from an entity property named `id` or ending with `Id` and an entity property named `version` designates an automatically incremented version column.

You define one or more repository interfaces for an entity, annotate those interfaces as `@Repository` and inject them into components via `@Inject`. The Jakarta Data provider supplies the implementation of the repository interface for you.

Here's a simple entity,

----
@Entity
public class Product {
    @Id
    public long id;

    public boolean isDiscounted;

    public String name;

    public float price;

    @Version
    public long version;
}
----

Here is a repository that defines operations relating to the entity. Your repository interface can inherit from built-in interfaces such as `BasicRepository` and `CrudRepository` to gain a variety of general purpose repository methods for inserting, updating, deleting and querying for entities. You can add methods to further customize it.

----
@Repository(dataStore = "java:app/jdbc/my-example-data")
public interface Products extends BasicRepository<Product, Long> {
    @Insert
    Product add(Product newProduct);

    // query-by-method name pattern:
    List<Product> findByNameIgnoreCaseContains(String searchFor, Order<Product> orderBy);

    // parameter based query that does not require -parameters because it explicitly specifies the name
    @Find
    Page<Product> find(@By("isDiscounted") boolean onSale,
                       PageRequest<Product> pageRequest);

    // find query in JDQL that requires compilation with -parameters to preserve parameter names
    @Query("SELECT price FROM Product WHERE id=:productId")
    Optional<Float> getPrice(long productId);

    // update query in JDQL:
    @Query("UPDATE Product SET price = price - (?2 * price), isDiscounted = true WHERE id = ?1")
    boolean discount(long productId, float discountRate);

    // delete query in JDQL:
    @Query("DELETE FROM Product WHERE name = ?1")
    int discontinue(String name);
}
----

Observe that the repository interface includes type parameters in `PageRequest<Product>` and `Order<Product>`.  This helps ensure that the page request and sort criteria are for a `Product` entity rather than some other entity.  To accomplish this, you can optionally define a Static Metamodel class for the entity (or various IDEs might generate one for you after the 1.0 specification is actually released).  Here is one that can be used with the `Product` entity,

----
@StaticMetamodel(Product.class)
public class _Product {
    public static final String ID = "id";
    public static final String IS_DISCOUNTED = "isDiscounted";
    public static final String NAME = "name";
    public static final String PRICE = "price";
    public static final String VERSION = "version";

    public static final SortableAttribute<Product> id = new SortableAttributeRecord(ID);
    public static final SortableAttribute<Product> isDiscounted = new SortableAttributeRecord(IS_DISCOUNTED);
    public static final TextAttribute<Product> name = new TextAttributeRecord(NAME);
    public static final SortableAttribute<Product> price = new SortableAttributeRecord(PRICE);
    public static final SortableAttribute<Product> version = new SortableAttributeRecord(VERSION);
}
----

Here is an example of the repository and static metamodel being used,

----
@DataSourceDefinition(name = "java:app/jdbc/my-example-data",
                      className = "org.postgresql.xa.PGXADataSource",
                      databaseName = "ExampleDB",
                      serverName = "localhost",
                      portNumber = 5432,
                      user = "${example.database.user}",
                      password = "${example.database.password}")
public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {
    @Inject
    Products products;

    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)
            throws ServletException, IOException {
        // Insert:
        Product prod = ...
        prod = products.add(prod);

        // Find the price of one product:
        price = products.getPrice(productId).orElseThrow();

        // Find all, sorted:
        List<Product> all = products.findByNameIgnoreCaseContains(searchFor, Order.by(
                                     _Product.price.desc(),
                                     _Product.name.asc(),
                                     _Product.id.asc()));

        // Find the first 20 most expensive products on sale:
        Page<Product> page1 = products.find(onSale, Order.by(_Product.price.desc(),
                                                             _Product.name.asc(),

                                                         .pageSize(20));

== Jakarta EE11 Servlet 6.1

The Open Liberty servlet-6.1 feature is an implementation of the Jakarta EE 11 Servlet 6.1 Specification. It includes a number of new features, specification clarifications as well as deprecates some existing Servlet features.`

Prior to Servlet 6.1, there was not a way for an application to control the response data when doing a send redirect, as well as the response status code which always set to 302.  An application could not easily retrieve the initial request's query string or request HTTP method during an error handling dispatch.  It also could not set the character encoding for a request or a response using the java.nio.charset.Charset; the only available option was using a String.  During the read or write of a servlet data, the jakarta.servlet.ServletInputStream or jakarta.servlet.ServletOutputStream only supports a byte array.`

Servlet 6.1 was updated to provide additional servlet APIs that allow the send redirect to include an optional response data and/or set a compliant status code, instead of the default 302.  Additional request attributes are available during the error handling process to easily retrieve the initial requestâs query string or method.  Further more, international application can now set the character encoding using a Charset instead of a String.  The ServletInputStream or ServletOutputStream can use java.nio.ByteBuffer to read or write the data.`

Several clarifications are added to clarify the behavior of the existing servlet APIs. For example, the getParameter family from the jakar.servlet.ServletRequest is now throwing the runtime java.lang.IllegalStateException when an error occurs during the parsing of the requestâs parameters.  While processing an error handling dispatch, the HTTP GET method is always used instead of the original requestâs HTTP method.`

== Use InstantOn with IBMÂ® MQ in Liberty 24.0.0.5-beta

The Liberty 24005-beta release introduces InstantOn feature support for link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/feature/messaging-3.0.html[Jakarta Messaging], link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/feature/connectors-2.1.html[Jakarta Connectors], and link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/feature/mdb-4.0.html[Jakarta Enterprise Beans Message-Driven Beans (MDB)].  InstantOn now provides blazing fast startup times for applications that use resource adapters to access external EIS resources -- including applications that use the Jakarta Messaging API to access external Messaging systems, like IBMÂ® MQ.  And, these "Messaging client" applications can manage message delivery to endpoints having Message-Driven bean listeners.

Here's a server configuration snippet to deploy applications that use the JakartaEE-10 Messaging API and require the link:https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/ibm/mq/wmq.jakarta.jmsra/9.3.5.0/wmq.jakarta.jmsra-9.3.5.0.rar[IBMÂ® MQ resource adapter] to access external Messaging resources.  This configuration automatically includes the `connectors-2.1` feature, which supports the resource adapter configuration element.

----

> Tip: Use the link:https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/mq-connect-app-queue-manager-containers/[MQ in Container image] to stand up an MQ server that provides the following resources: queue manager `QM1`, queue `DEV.QUEUE.1`, channel `DEV.APP.SVRCONN`, and listener `SYSTEM.LISTENER.TCP.1` on port `1414`.  These resources can support a simple point-to-point messaging scenario and are named within the Messaging feature configuration elements shown below.

InstantOn can dynamically update the Messaging and Connectors feature configurations to access resources provided by any environment in which a server is restored from checkpoint. The Messaging configuration snippet below uses the hostname and MQ listener port values (variables) defined in the restore environment. When this server has restored, the connection factory and endpoint activation configurations will access MQ resources using the updated hostname and port values.

=== Try it now

To try out these features, update your build tools to pull the Open Liberty All Beta Features package instead of the main release. The beta works with Java SE 22, Java SE 21, Java SE 17, Java SE 11, and Java SE 8.

If you're using link:{url-prefix}/guides/maven-intro.html[Maven], you can install the All Beta Features package using:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.10.2</version>
    <configuration>
        <runtimeArtifact>
          <groupId>io.openliberty.beta</groupId>
          <artifactId>openliberty-runtime</artifactId>
          <version>24.0.0.5-beta</version>
          <type>zip</type>
        </runtimeArtifact>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

You must also add dependencies to your pom.xml file for the beta version of the APIs that are associated with the beta features that you want to try. For example, the following block adds dependencies for two example beta APIs:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.example.spec</groupId>
    <artifactId>exampleApi</artifactId>
    <version>7.0</version>
    <type>pom</type>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>example.platform</groupId>
    <artifactId>example.example-api</artifactId>
    <version>11.0.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----

Or for link:{url-prefix}/guides/gradle-intro.html[Gradle]:

[source,gradle]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'io.openliberty.tools:liberty-gradle-plugin:3.8.2'
    }
}
apply plugin: 'liberty'
dependencies {
    libertyRuntime group: 'io.openliberty.beta', name: 'openliberty-runtime', version: '[24.0.0.5-beta,)'
}
