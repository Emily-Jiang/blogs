== Support for Java 22 in Open Liberty

Java 22 is the latest release of Java, released in March 2024. It contains new features and enhancements over previous versions of Java. However, Java 22 is not a long-term support (LTS) release and support for it will be dropped when the next version of Java is supported. It offers some new functions and changes that you are going to want to check out for yourself.
