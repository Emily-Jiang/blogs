Primeur, an independent software vendor (ISV) based in Italy, focuses on providing smart data integration. They embed Open Liberty Java runtime in their flagship data integration platform, DATA ONE. Open Liberty enables Primeur to make the embedded Java runtime invisible to their data integration customers, while still observable to Primeur’s engineers to be able to support them.

For over 35 years, Primeur have been helping companies from all over the world to accelerate their data integration projects, ensuring their customers reach their business goals while making the most of their existing IT investments and avoiding unnecessary expenses. To help their clients achieve this, Primeur established their flagship data integration platform, link:https://www.primeur.com/data-one[DATA ONE], in 2020 which is designed to federate different technologies, platforms, data types and deployment models. Primeur embed the Open Liberty Java runtime in DATA ONE, using it to power the core data integration choreographies. 


== Why choose Open Liberty?

Primeur says they fell in love with Open Liberty when using it within this project. The two greatest features that Primeur values from Liberty are its invisibility and observability. Although these features may seem like a contradiction and might not be something you have considered when selecting a cloud-native runtime, these two factors are critical for Primeur’s business. This is because the perspective of an ISV embedding Open Liberty inside its products is different from that of a business customer installing Open Liberty (whether on-prem or in a cloud environment) to run its business application.


== Invisibility

The great benefit of Open Liberty’s ability to remain invisible to our clients, is that Primeur can embed, completely configure, and operate Open Liberty within their DATA ONE product without their customers having to be aware that Open Liberty is even there. Their customers need only care about DATA ONE. So customers’ developers don’t have to skill up on yet another technology or care about how to operate the runtime that their platform is based upon.


== Observability

In almost complete contrast to invisibility, Primeur also required a runtime that enables great observability. As an ISV, Primeur are aware that shipping products, installing them at customer sites in the most frictionless way, and adopting them for production environments is just the beginning of what can be a long journey that can last several years until the next major product version upgrade. During this time, customers raise support requests to investigate problems that arise in the product but whose root cause can often be challenging to identify.

In the ever-increasing complexity of application architecture, cloud-native tooling and distributed cloud infrastructure, bottlenecks and failure points can be very remote and well-hidden making them especially difficult to detect. It is vitally important for Primeur to be able to diagnose any problems the occur as quickly as possible to limit the impact on their customer’s business. This is why observability is critical for Primeur. Their support team needs to be able to effectively and efficiently monitor, trace and generally probe Open Liberty until they are able to identify the root cause of the problem that the customer is facing.


== Additional valuable Liberty features

Primeur also liked the flexibility of Open Liberty in helping their customers to move at their own pace from more traditional deployment models to containerized deployments in the cloud. Open Liberty supports the use of cloud-native frameworks and platforms, like Jakarta EE, MicroProfile, and OpenShift. Open Liberty also enables Primeur to deploy DATA ONE either natively or in containers, according to their customers’ preferences and skills. This flexibility means that their customers can transition from traditional to containerized deployments at their own pace.

Open Liberty’s frequent updates with security and non-security fixes, and its zero migration architecture, mean that Primeur’s DATA ONE can be kept up-to-date and secure. They can also access IBM’s support to mitigate complex risks and to solve challenging problems.
