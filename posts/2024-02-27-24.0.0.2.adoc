== Negative acknowledgement and more for MicroProfile Reactive Messaging 3.0 and MicroProfile Stream Operators 3.0

MicroProfile Reactive Messaging 3.0 has a number of new features and changes over MicroProfile Reactive Messaging 1.0, including negative acknowledgements, emitters, and backpressure support.

An application using MicroProfile Reactive Messaging or MicroProfile Stream Operators is typically composed of CDI beans that consume, produce, and process messages that are passing along reactive streams. These messages can be internal to the application, or they can be sent and received through external message brokers. MicroProfile Reactive Messaging uses MicroProfile Stream Operators to pass messages through channels between methods or to messaging solutions, such as Kafka, to provide resilient storage of messages.

MicroProfile Reactive Messaging and Reactive Stream Operators 3.0 provide a range of new features and is compatible with Jakarta EE 9 onwards.

To use both features together, add the Microprofile Reactive Messaging 3.0 feature to the `server.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<feature>mpReactiveMessaging-3.0</feature>
----

Enabling MicroProfile Reactive Messaging 3.0 automatically enables the MicroProfile Reactive Stream Operators 3.0 feature too.

To use MicroProfile Reactive Stream Operators 3.0 without MicroProfile Reactive Messaging:

[source,xml]
----
<feature>mpReactiveStreams-3.0</feature>
----


=== Negative acknowledgements

In MicroProfile Reactive Messaging 1.0, Messages could only be positively acknowledged. If there was a problem with the payload or if exceptional behavior occurred, there was no mechanism to indicate the problem or to handle the problem if it occurred within the stream. The new _nack_ support can send or handle these events.

To explicitly negatively acknowledge an incoming Message:

[source,java]
----
@Incoming("data")
@Outgoing("out")
public Message<String> process(Message<String> m) { 
    String s = m.getPayload();
    if (s.equalsIgnoreCase("b")) {
        // we cannot fail, we must nack explicitly.
        m.nack(new IllegalArgumentException("b"));
        return null;
    }
    return m.withPayload(s.toUpperCase());
}
----

The method signature of accepting a Message without defining an acknowledgement strategy defaults the strategy to `MANUAL`. It is the responsibility of your code to `ack()` or `nack()` the message. In the previous example, the message can be acknowledged downstream of the out channel.

To throw an exception that causes a negative acknowledgement:

[source,java]
----
@Incoming("data")
@Outgoing("out")
public String process(String s) {  
    if (s.equalsIgnoreCase("b")) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("b"); 
    }
    return s.toUpperCase();
}
----

The method signature of accepting a payload without defining an acknowledgement strategy defaults the strategy to `POST_PROCESSING`. The implementation handles `ack()` and `nack()` calls on the message after the method or chain completes. The upstream data receives the negative acknowledgement with the reason of `IllegalArgumentException`. In the case of an exception being thrown, the implementation invokes the 'nack()' on the message.

=== Emitters

MicroProfile Reactive Messaging 1.0 did not offer a clear way to integrate imperative code, such as RESTful resources and beans, because Reactive Messaging put and took messages onto a channel according to the `Outgoing` or `Incoming` annotations. In version 3.0, emitters provide a bridge across the two models.

To inject emitters into a RESTful resources by using CDI to put messages onto a given channel:

[source,java]
----
@Inject
@Channel(CHANNEL_NAME)
Emitter<String> emitter;

@POST
@Path("/payload")
public CompletionStage<Void> emitPayload(String payload){
    CompletionStage<Void> cs = emitter.send(payload);
    return cs;
}

@POST
@Path("/message")
public CompletionStage<Void> emitPayload(String payload){
    CompletableFuture<Void> ackCf = new CompletableFuture<>();
    emitter.send(Message.of(payload,
        () -> {
            ackCf.complete(null);
            return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(null);
        },
        t -> {
            ackCf.completeExceptionally(t);
            return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(null);
        }));
    return ackCf;
}
----

When defining emitters, you define the type of Object that will be sent as either the payload or the contents of the Message.

If an emitter sends a payload, MicroProfile Reactive Messaging automatically handles the invocation of `ack()` and `nack()` on the message. If, however, the emitter sends a message, the sending code must handle the message being either acked or nacked downstream.

=== Backpressure support

Backpressure support handles messages or payloads that are emitted faster than they are consumed. A backpressure strategy defines application behaviour in this circumstance. In the following example, the buffer holds up to 300 messages and throws an exception if it is full when a new message is emitted:

[source,java]
----
@Inject @Channel("myChannel")
@OnOverflow(value=OnOverflow.Strategy.BUFFER, bufferSize=300)
private Emitter<String> emitter;

public void publishMessage() {
  emitter.send("a");
  emitter.send("b");
  emitter.complete();
}
----


You can define the following backpressure strategies:

* `BUFFER` - Use a buffer, with a size determined by the value of bufferSize, if set. Otherwise, the size is the value of the `mp.messaging.emitter.default-buffer-size` MicroProfile Config property,  if it exists. If neither of these values is defined, the default size is 128. If the buffer is full, an exception is thrown from the send method. This is the default strategy if no other strategy is defined.
* `DROP` - Drops the most recent value if the downstream can’t keep up. Any new values emitted by the emitter are ignored.
* `FAIL` - Propagates a failure in case the downstream can’t keep up. No more values will be emitted.
* `LATEST`- Keeps only the latest value, dropping any previous value if the downstream can’t keep up.
* `NONE` - Ignores the backpressure signals and leave it to the downstream consumer to implement a strategy.
* `THROW_EXCEPTION` - Throws an exception from the send method if the downstream can’t keep up.
* `UNBOUNDED_BUFFER` - Use an unbounded buffer. The application might run out of memory if values are continually added faster than they are consumed.

An application using MicroProfile  Reactive Messaging or MicroProfile Stream Operators is typically composed of CDI beans consuming, producing and processing messages passing along reactive streams. These messages can be internal to the application or can be sent and received via different message brokers.

MicroProfile Reactive Messaging uses Stream Operators to pass messages via channels either between methods or to messaging solutions such as Kafka to provide resilient storage of messages.

MicroProfile Reactive Messaging and Reactive Stream Operators 3.0 provide a range of new features and is compatible with Jakarta EE9 onwards.

To use either feature specify the following features in the `server.xml`

To use MicroProfile Reactive Messaging 3.0*
```
<feature>mpReactiveMessaging-3.0</feature>
```

*Enabling MicroProfile Reactive Messaging 3.0 will enable the MicroProfile Reactive Stream Operators 3.0 feature

To use MicroProfile Reactive Stream Operators 3.0 without MicroProfile Reactive Messaging:
```
<feature>mpReactiveStreams-3.0</feature>
```

MicroProfile Reactive Messaging 3.0 has a number of new features and changes over the 1.0

**Negative Acknowledgements**
In MicroProfile Reactive Messaging 1.0. Messages could only be positively acknowledged. So if there was an issue with the payload or exceptional behavior occurred, there was no mechanism to either indicate an issue, or handle an issue if one were to occur within the stream. To address this `nack` support was added such these events could sent or handled.

Explicitly `nack` an incoming message:
```
@Incoming("data")
@Outgoing("out")
public Message<String> process(Message<String> m) { 
    String s = m.getPayload();
    if (s.equalsIgnoreCase("b")) {
        // we cannot fail, we must nack explicitly.
        m.nack(new IllegalArgumentException("b"));
        return null;
    }
    return m.withPayload(s.toUpperCase());
}
```
The method signature of accepting a `Message` indicates that the acknowledgement strategy for this method is `MANUAL`. As such it is the responsibility of the user code to ack() and nack() the message. In the above the message can be acknowledged by the downstream of the `out` channel.

Throwing an exception that will case a nack:
```
@Incoming("data")
@Outgoing("out")
public String process(String s) {  
    if (s.equalsIgnoreCase("b")) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("b"); 
    }
    return s.toUpperCase();
}
```
The method signature of accepting a payload indicates that the acknowledgement strategy for this method is `POST_PROCESSING`. As such the implementation will handle ack() and nack() calls on the message after the method or chain completes. The upstream of `data` will receive the nack with the reason of `IllegalArgumentException`. 


**Emitters**
      One significant limitation of 1.0 of the specification was how to integrate Imperative code such as RESTful resources and Reactive Beans which would put and take messages on to a channel via the `Outgoing` or `Incoming` annotations. in 2.0, Emitters were introduced to provide a bridge across the who models. 

Emitters can be injected via CDI into a RESTful resources to put messages on to a given channel.

```
@Inject
@Channel(CHANNEL_NAME)
Emitter<String> emitter;

@POST
@Path("/payload")
public CompletionStage<Void> emitPayload(String payload){
    CompletionStage<Void> cs = emitter.send(payload);
    return cs;
}

@POST
@Path("/message")
public CompletionStage<Void> emitPayload(String payload){
    CompletableFuture<Void> ackCf = new CompletableFuture<>();
    emitter.send(Message.of(payload,
        () -> {
            ackCf.complete(null);
            return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(null);
        },
        t -> {
            ackCf.completeExceptionally(t);
            return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(null);
        }));
    return ackCf;
}
```
If an emitter sends a payload then the implementation will handle the basic invocation of ack() and nack(). However if it sends a Message it is the responsibility of the user to handle the message being either acked or nacked.

**Backpressure support**
Back pressure support allows for the situation where emitting messages/payloads faster than the consumption of the messages. The defining of a strategy allows for the emitter to behave in expected ways.

```
@Inject @Channel("myChannel")
@OnOverflow(value=OnOverflow.Strategy.BUFFER, bufferSize=300)
private Emitter<String> emitter;

public void publishMessage() {
  emitter.send("a");
  emitter.send("b");
  emitter.complete();
}
```
In this example the Buffer will hold up to 300 messages, before throwing an exception if it is full with a new message being emitted.

The following strategies can be defined:
- `BUFFER` - use a buffer, whose size will be determined by the value of bufferSize if set. Otherwise, the size will be the value of the config property mp.messaging.emitter.default-buffer-size if it exists. Otherwise, 128 will be used. If the buffer is full, an exception will be thrown from the send method. This is the default strategy if no other strategy is defined
- `DROP` - drops the most recent value if the downstream can’t keep up. It means that new value emitted by the emitter are ignored.
- `FAIL` - propagates a failure in case the downstream can’t keep up. No more value will be emitted.
- `LATEST`- keeps only the latest value, dropping any previous value if the downstream can’t keep up.
- `NONE` - ignores the back pressure signals letting the downstream consumer to implement a strategy.
- `THROW_EXCEPTION`  - throws an exception from the send method if the downstream can’t keep up.
- `UNBOUNDED_BUFFER` - use an unbounded buffer. The application may run out of memory if values are continually added faster than they are consumed.

**New Liberty-kafka connector options**
OpenLiberty provides a Kafka connector for use with MicroProfile Reactive Messaging for the sending and receiving of messages using Kafka as a messaging intermediary.

Two new options have been added to the connector.

***fast.ack***
`fast.ack` is a boolean attribute that determines the acknowledgement behavior of the Connector for incoming channels.

- true: an acknowledgement is reported as complete as soon as the Kafka Connector receives the acknowledgement signal.
- false: an acknowledgement is not reported as complete until the partition offset has been committed to the Kafka broker. If an error occurs during this process, thenthe acknowledgement is reported as failed.

`fast.ack` is defined as an attribute on either the `liberty-kafka` connector or an incoming channel. If specified on an outgoing channel it is ignored. 

***Example***
microprofile-config.properties:
```
mp.messaging.connector.liberty-kafka.fast.ack=false

mp.messaginging.incoming.foo.connector=liberty-kafka
mp.messaginging.incoming.foo.fast.ack=true
```
In the above example, the connector sets the standard value used by all channels. However, channel `foo` will use the value `true` as Channel attributes take precedence over Connector attributes.


For mpReactiveMessaging-1.0 the default value of the option is `false`
For mpReactiveMessaging-3.0 the default value of the option is `true`

***context.service***
`context.service` allows for the specifying of the context service used for the undertaking of asynchronous tasks.

The value of the `context.service` attribute is a reference to the `id` of a context.service defined in `server.xml`

****`context.service` example:****
In the server.xml 3 different context services are defined with unique ids. In the application's `microprofile-config.properties` file. the first context service is set on the connector. The application has three channels, The channel `def` does not specify its own context.service, so it uses the one defined on the connector. The second and third channels define their own services and will use those respectively.

server.xml:
```
<contextService id=“rst”/>
<contextService id=“uvw”/>
<contextService id=“xyz”/>
```

microprofile-config.properties:
```
mp.messaging.connector.liberty-kafka.context.service=rst

mp.messaging.incoming.def.connector=liberty-kafka
mp.messaging.incoming.foo.connector=liberty-kafka
mp.messaging.incoming.foo.context.service=uvw
mp.messaging.outgoing.bar.connector=liberty-kafka
mp.messaging.outgoing.bar.context.service=xyz
```

If the `concurrent-x.y` feature is enabled. the default context service is used. If the concurrent feature is not enabled, the built in Open Liberty context service is used with a set list of context types to capture and apply around asynchronous tasks

+
If the Transaction Service is logging to a database and using recoveryGroups, locking the lease table (for example during a DB backup) exhibits the following behaviour:
+
App servers trying to update the lease will hang/fail after timeout, so leases will be stale (expected in such a scenario)
App servers trying to look for stale leases will read the leases and increase the stale lease detection count for other app servers and potentially trigger peer recovery if the leaseExpiryThreshold is exceeded.  The issue here is that the leaseExpiryThreshold could easeily be breached.  The reason why the reading of the leases works without hanging is because a standard SELECT is used (and isolation level is default TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED) - changing that to SELECT FOR UPDATE (and equivalents in different database servers) should allow the leaseExpiryThreshold (when >1) to prevent this situation triggering peer recovery (where it should be noted, timestamp staleness for the leases and logs would be subject to a race condition - the one that the leaseExpiryThreshold was intended to address).
