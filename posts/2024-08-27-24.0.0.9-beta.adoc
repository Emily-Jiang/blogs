In this release, you can use the MicroProfile Telemetry 2.0 beta feature to send logs and metrics, along with distributed traces, to OpenTelemetry. A minor update for the WebSocket 2.2 beta feature is also included.

The link:{url-about}[Open Liberty] 24.0.0.9-beta includes the following beta features (along with link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/feature/feature-overview.html[all GA features]):

* <<metrics, Send Liberty metrics to OpenTelemetry>>
* <<logs, Send logs to OpenTelemetry>>
* <<websocket, Jakarta EE11 WebSocket 2.2>>

== Send Liberty metrics to OpenTelemetry

MicroProfile Telemetry 2.0 provides you with the latest Open Telemetry technology. In addition to distributed tracing, the feature now allows OpenTelemetry to collect and export metrics and logs.

When the MicroProfile Telemetry 2.0 beta feature (`mpTelemetry-2.0`) is enabled, Open Liberty can now forward runtime component statistics that are captured by the link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/feature/monitor-1.0.html[Performance Monitoring 1.0] feature (`monitor-1.0`) to the MicroProfile Telemetry 2.0 runtime. This statistical data is registered as metrics in the telemetry runtime and can then be forwarded to any OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) compatible metric consumer to meet your monitoring needs.

The following runtime components are supported:

* `ThreadPool`
* `Sessions`
* `RequestTiming`
* `ConnectionPool`

The `mpTelemetry-2.0` feature automatically starts the `monitor-1.0` feature. Enable the `mpTelemetry-2.0` feature and any features that are associated with your chosen supported runtime components.

For example, the `ConnectionPool` component requires the following configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<featureManager>
   <feature>mpTelemetry-2.0</feature>
   <feature>jdbc-4.3</feature>
</featureManager>

== Send logs to OpenTelemetry

The `mpTelemetry-2.0` feature can now collect Open Liberty runtime log sources (messages, traces, ffdcs) and application logs generated through the `java.util.logging` package (JUL).

To enable the MicroProfile Telemetry 2.0 feature to collect all logs, add the following configuration to your `server.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<features>
   <feature>mpTelemetry-2.0</feature>
</features>

<mpTelemetry source="message, trace, ffdc"/>
----

If the `mpTelemetry` configuration element or the `source` attribute is not configured, the `message` source is set by default. In this case, only messages are collected. If the `source` attribute is specified empty (`source=""`), no logs are sent to OpenTelemetry.

To collect and export runtime-level logs, enable OpenTelemetry by using the following system property or environment variable:

* System property: `otel.sdk.disabled=false`
* Environment variable: `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=false`

To separately configure multiple applications in a server, you can configure OpenTelemetry with application configuration. However, you cannot collect runtime-level logs this way.

By default, all OpenTelemetry data is exported to link:https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/java/exporters/#otlp[OTLP]. You can change each exporter with the following property or environment variable:

* System property: `otel.logs.exporter`
* Environment variable: `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER`

[#websocket]
== Avoid type errors with WebSocket 2.2

To avoid type errors, this beta release of the WebSocket 2.2 feature (`websocket-2.2`) limits the link:https://jakarta.ee/specifications/websocket/2.2/apidocs/server/jakarta/websocket/onmessage#maxMessageSize([MaxMessageSize]) to `Integer#MAX_VALUE` for the `OnMessage` annotation. The websocket-2.2 feature was previously released in beta in the 24.0.0.8-beta.


To enable this beta feature, add the following code to your `server.xml` file.

[source,xml]
----
<featureManager>
    <feature>websocket-2.2</feature>
</featureManager>
----
For more information, such as the JavaDocs, specification documents, and other details, see link:https://jakarta.ee/specifications/websocket/2.2/[Jakarta WebSocket 2.2].

To enable the new beta features in your app, add them to your `server.xml`:

=== Try it now

To try out these features, update your build tools to pull the Open Liberty All Beta Features package instead of the main release. The beta works with Java SE 22, Java SE 21, Java SE 17, Java SE 11, and Java SE 8.

If you're using link:{url-prefix}/guides/maven-intro.html[Maven], you can install the All Beta Features package using:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.10.3</version>
    <configuration>
        <runtimeArtifact>
          <groupId>io.openliberty.beta</groupId>
          <artifactId>openliberty-runtime</artifactId>
          <version>24.0.0.9-beta</version>
          <type>zip</type>
        </runtimeArtifact>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

You must also add dependencies to your pom.xml file for the beta version of the APIs that are associated with the beta features that you want to try. For example, the following block adds dependencies for two example beta APIs:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.example.spec</groupId>
    <artifactId>exampleApi</artifactId>
    <version>7.0</version>
    <type>pom</type>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>example.platform</groupId>
    <artifactId>example.example-api</artifactId>
    <version>11.0.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----

Or for link:{url-prefix}/guides/gradle-intro.html[Gradle]:

[source,gradle]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'io.openliberty.tools:liberty-gradle-plugin:3.8.3'
    }
}
apply plugin: 'liberty'
dependencies {
    libertyRuntime group: 'io.openliberty.beta', name: 'openliberty-runtime', version: '[24.0.0.9-beta,)'
}
