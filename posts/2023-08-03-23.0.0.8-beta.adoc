== Spring Boot 3.0 support

The Liberty Spring Boot Support 3.0 feature provides more complete support for running a Spring Boot 3.0 application on Liberty. It also provides the capability to "thin" the application when you create applications in containers. 

Prior releases of Liberty provided support for Spring Boot 1.5 and Spring Boot 2.0 applications.  Liberty has also supported Spring Boot applications packaged as a WAR file, as demonstrated in link:https://openliberty.io/blog/2023/06/15/running-spring-boot-3.html[this recent blog post].  The Open Liberty 23.0.0.8-beta release enables you to deploy Spring Boot 3.x applications by enabling the `springboot-3.0` feature, with support for both JAR and WAR file types.

To run a Spring Boot 3.x application on Liberty, you must be running with Java 17 or higher.  Additionally, if your application uses the link:/docs/latest/reference/feature/servlet.html[Jakarta Servlet] feature, it must be Jakarta Servet 6.0. Configure these features in the `server.xml` file, as shown in the following example:

[source,xml]
----
<features>
   <feature>springboot-3.0</feature>
   <feature>servlet-6.0</feature>
</features>
----

As with previous versions of the Spring Boot Support feature, Spring Boot application JAR files can be placed in the `/dropins/spring/` directory.  Alternatively, specify the link:/docs/latest/reference/config/springBootApplication.html[Spring Boot configuration elements] in the `server.xml` file. For example:

[source,xml]
----
 <springBootApplication id="spring-boot-app" location="spring-boot-app-0.1.0.jar" name="spring-boot-app" />
----

If you have used previous versions of the Spring Boot Support feature and are now migrating your application to use Spring Boot 3, note the following requirements:

* link:/docs/latest/reference/feature/webProfile-10.0.html[Jakarta EE 10 features] must be used. 

* Security configuration requires in-application modifications.Â

  - link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/authorization/authorize-http-requests.html[Authorize HttpServletRequests]

* A new server template (`springBoot3`) is available.

== Early preview of Jakarta Data

The 23.0.0.8-beta release also includes a preview of Jakarta Data.  More information is available in the link:{url-prefix}/blog/2023/07/11/23.0.0.7-beta.html[Jakarta Data beta 2 update in Open Liberty 23.0.0.7-beta] blog post.

=== Try it now 

To try out these features, update your build tools to pull the Open Liberty All Beta Features package instead of the main release. The beta works with Java SE 20, Java SE 17, Java SE 11, and Java SE 8.

If you're using link:{url-prefix}/guides/maven-intro.html[Maven], add the All Beta Features package to your `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>RELEASE</version>
    <configuration>
        <runtimeArtifact>
          <groupId>io.openliberty.beta</groupId>
          <artifactId>openliberty-runtime</artifactId>
          <version>23.0.0.8-beta</version>
          <type>zip</type>
        </runtimeArtifact>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

You must also add dependencies to your pom.xml file for the beta version of the APIs that are associated with the beta features that you want to try.  For example, for Jakarta Data Beta 2, you would include:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>jakarta.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>jakarta-data-api</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0-b2</version>
</dependency>
----

Or for link:{url-prefix}/guides/gradle-intro.html[Gradle]:

[source,gradle]
----
dependencies {
    libertyRuntime group: 'io.openliberty.beta', name: 'openliberty-runtime', version: '[23.0.0.8-beta,)'
}
----

Or if you're using link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/container-images.html[container images]:

[source]
----
FROM icr.io/appcafe/open-liberty:beta
----

Or take a look at our link:{url-prefix}/downloads/#runtime_betas[Downloads page].
