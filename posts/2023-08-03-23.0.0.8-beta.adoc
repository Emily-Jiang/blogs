== Spring Boot 3.0 support

The Liberty Spring Boot Support 3.0 feature provides more complete support for running a Spring Boot 3.0 application on Liberty as well as having the capability to "thin" the application when creating applications in containers. 

Prior releases of Liberty provided support for Spring Boot 1.5 and Spring Boot 2.0 applications.  In the 23.0.0.3 release, support was extended to include link:/blog/2023/06/15/running-spring-boot-3.html[Running a Spring Boot 3.x application WAR file on Liberty].  With this new Spring Boot 3.0 feature, users now have support for both `.wars` and `.jars` by enabling the `springboot-3.0` feature.

To run a Spring Boot 3.x application on Liberty, you must be running with Java 17 or higher.  Additionally, if your application uses the link:/docs/latest/reference/feature/servlet.html[Jakarta Servlet] feature, it must be Jakarta Servet 6.0.  The features can be configured via the `server.xml` file as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<features>
   <feature>springboot-3.0</feature>
   <feature>servlet-6.0</feature>
</features>
----

As with previous versions of the Spring Boot feature, specify link:/docs/latest/reference/config/springBootApplication.html[Spring Boot configuration elements] in the `server.xml` file. For example:

[source,xml]
----
 <springBootApplication id="spring-boot-app" location="spring-boot-app-0.1.0.jar" name="spring-boot-app" />
----

If you have used previous versions of the Spring Boot feature and are now migrating your application to use Spring Boot 3, note the following requirements:

* link:/docs/latest/reference/feature/webProfile-10.0.html[Jakarta EE 10 features] must be used. 

* Security configuration requires in-application modifications.Â

* A new server template (`springBoot3`) is available.

=== Try it now 

To try out these features, update your build tools to pull the Open Liberty All Beta Features package instead of the main release. The beta works with Java SE 20, Java SE 17, Java SE 11, and Java SE 8.

If you're using link:{url-prefix}/guides/maven-intro.html[Maven], add the All Beta Features package to your `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>RELEASE</version>
    <configuration>
        <runtimeArtifact>
          <groupId>io.openliberty.beta</groupId>
          <artifactId>openliberty-runtime</artifactId>
          <version>23.0.0.8-beta</version>
          <type>zip</type>
        </runtimeArtifact>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

You must also add dependencies to your pom.xml file for the beta version of the APIs that are associated with the beta features that you want to try.  For example, for Jakarta Data Beta 2, you would include:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>jakarta.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>jakarta-data-api</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0-b2</version>
</dependency>
----

Or for link:{url-prefix}/guides/gradle-intro.html[Gradle]:

[source,gradle]
----
dependencies {
    libertyRuntime group: 'io.openliberty.beta', name: 'openliberty-runtime', version: '[23.0.0.8-beta,)'
}
----

Or if you're using link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/container-images.html[container images]:

[source]
----
FROM icr.io/appcafe/open-liberty:beta
----

Or take a look at our link:{url-prefix}/downloads/#runtime_betas[Downloads page].
