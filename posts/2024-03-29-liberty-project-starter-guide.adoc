[#prerequisites]
== Java Prerequisites

To initiate the Open Liberty project on your end, it is necessary to install Java. It is recommended to install either Java 17 or Java 21.

Please refer to the link for setting up:

- Java: https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/semeru-runtimes-installation

Find out more about Setting up Java:

- There are multiple Java distributions; find out more in link:https://foojay.io/today/where-do-you-get-your-java/[Where do you get your Java]?

Once Java installation is completed, please ensure the `JAVA_HOME` variable have been properly config in your system path. The `JAVA_HOME` variable is essential for Maven and Gradle Liberty projects. It helps to indicate which JVM to use. If the JVM is not set, the system default is used. Please locate the Java installation path on your system, and then export or set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable accordingly.

[role='command']
```
export JAVA_HOME=<your Java installation path>
```

[#libertyStarter]
== Creating a Liberty Project with Efficiency: Open Liberty Starter

The Open Liberty Starter provides a simple way for initiating an Open Liberty project. Visit the link:https://openliberty.io/start/[Open Liberty Starter page], define your application and project name, select a build tool (either Maven or Gradle), and indicate the preferred versions of Java SE, Jakarta EE, and MicroProfile for your application. Finally, click on `Generate Project` to download your project seamlessly.

[#AboutProject]
== Overview of the Liberty Project

=== Maven project
If you are working with Maven as your build tool, within the `app-name` directory, the `pom.xml` file containing configuration details for the project, encompassing dependencies, plugins, and other settings.

==== Declaring dependencies
Maven manage the project through the Maven configuration `pom.xml` file. To declare dependencies, `<dependencies>` section should be used. For example:

[source]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>jakarta.platform</groupId>
        <artifactId>jakarta.jakartaee-api</artifactId>
        <version>10.0.0</version>
        <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

In this example, the `jakarta.jakartaee-api` from `jakarta.platform` has been introduced as a dependency for this project. 

For adding or updating dependencies in a Maven project, you can visit the link:https://mvnrepository.com/[Maven Library] for more information.

==== Adding plugins
Plugins enhance the functionality of Maven by providing additional capabilities. Common plugins encompass tasks such as compiling code, running tests, packaging applications, and more. For instance:

[source]
----
<pluginManagement>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
            <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.10</version>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</pluginManagement>
----

//explain lmp here
In this example, the `liberty-maven-plugin` from `io.openliberty.tools` has been introduced as a plugin for this project. The Liberty Maven Plugin offers several goals for managing a Liberty runtime, including tasks such as downloading and installing the Liberty runtime, starting or stopping a Liberty server in development mode, installing features, and deploying applications. Please visit link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven/blob/main/README.md[Liberty Maven Plugin Document] for more information.

=== Gradle project
If you selected Gradle as your build tool, examine the `app-name` demo project directory to locate the Gradle configuration `build.gradle` file.

==== Declaring dependencies
To declare dependencies, you can use the `dependencies` block in the `build.gradle` file. For example:

[source]
----
dependencies {
    // provided dependencies
    providedCompile 'jakarta.platform:jakarta.jakartaee-api:10.0.0' 
}
----

==== Adding plugins
In Gradle, plugins may be applied directly or introduced via the `plugins` block. For instance:

[source]
----
plugins {
    id 'war'
    id 'io.openliberty.tools.gradle.Liberty' version '3.8'
}
----

In this example, the Gradle plugin for managing Liberty servers has been introduced as a plugin for this project. The Liberty Gradle plugin supports the installation and operational control of Liberty runtime and servers. It can help manage your application on Liberty for integration tests and to create Liberty server packages. Please visit link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.gradle/blob/main/README.md[Liberty Gradle Plugin Document] for more information.

=== Project structure

A well-organized file structure is crucial for Maven and Gradle projects, providing a clear framework for development. This hierarchy includes directories for application code, MicroProfile, Liberty configuration and tests.

image::img/blog/liberty-app-directory-img.png[Liberty Project directory image,width=40%,align="center"]

Referring to the demo Maven/Gradle project's structure shown in the picture: 

- `src/main/java`: Java application code files
- `src/main/liberty/config`: Liberty configuration files
- `src/main/resources/META-INF`: MicroProfile configuration files
- `src/test`: Test files
- `Dockerfile`: Dockerfile for building the Docker image

For Maven project only

- `mvnw`/`mvnw.cmd`: Maven Wrapper script for Unix-like/Windows systems

For Gradle project only

- `gradlew`/`gradlew.bat`: Gradle Wrapper script for Unix-like/Windows systems

[#LibertyTools]
== Introducing Liberty Tools
Liberty Tools enhances the application development experience with Open Liberty by providing convenient features. It includes a Liberty Dashboard for organizing projects and integrates Liberty dev mode directly into your IDE. The Liberty Dashboard effectively manages Maven and Gradle projects, seamlessly integrating configurations for Open Liberty. Moreover, it facilitates rapid development of MicroProfile and Jakarta EE applications by offering automatic code blocks, auto-complete functionality, and real-time syntax validation. With just a few clicks, you can start or stop your app, run tests, and check reports. Liberty dev mode can swiftly apply code changes to your running app without needing to restart the server, ensuring faster development.

[#LibertyToolsInstallation]
== Installing Liberty Tools for IDE Enhancement

[#tryLibertyDevMode]
== Trying Liberty dev mode

Dev mode can automatically detect, recompile, and deploy code changes whenever you save a new change in your IDE or text editor. To try out this feature, an example of creating a simple REST Resource Java File is provided.

Please check out the project and ensure that Liberty dev mode is running. Then, create a new Java class file named `HelloWorldResource.java` as the REST resource.

[source]
```
src/main/java/com/demo/rest/HelloWorldResource.java
```

and paste following code into the file: 

[source,java]
```
package com.demo.rest;

import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Produces;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

@Path("/hello")
public class HelloWorldResource{

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String helloWorld() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
}
```

Once the console displays `Web application available`, it indicates that the Liberty server has successfully detected, recompiled and deployed the changes. You can now view the message drafted in the example by accessing the link: http://localhost:9080/app-name/api/hello
