== Notable bugs fixed in this release

We’ve spent some time fixing bugs. The following sections describe just some of the issues resolved in this release. If you’re interested, here’s the  link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues?q=label%3Arelease%3A23005+label%3A%22release+bug%22[full list of bugs fixed in 23.0.0.5].

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/24577[Memory Leak in MicroProfile OpenAPI's SchemaRegistry.current]
+
A user reported a memory leak that occurred with each application restart, where 100MB of additional memory was used each time.  The culprit ended up coming from MicroProfile OpenAPI's `SchemaRegistry` class.
+
This issue has been reported upstream to SmallRye, and has also been fixed directly in Liberty.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/24864[HTTP/2 max frame size exceeded when compression is used]
+
When compression is configured in the `server.xml` on an `httpendpoint` and `http/2` is used, the `http/2` max frame size may be exceeded, leading to a `FRAME_SIZE_ERROR` appearing in the server's log.
+
This issue has been resolved and the `http/2` response data is now split into multiple data frames to avoid sending a data frame larger than the `http/2` max frame size of the client.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/25010[EntryNotFoundException thrown in federated registries when using custom input/output configuration]
+
When running with `federatedRegistries-1.0`, it is possible to get an `EntryNotFoundException` when defining a non-identifier type property for the federated registries input/output mapping. This exception can occur in any of the `com.ibm.ws.security.wim.registry.util.*Bridge` classes, but the key is it originates from a `BridgeUtils.getEntityByIdentifier` call.
+
The following is an example stack:
+
[source]
----
com.ibm.websphere.security.EntryNotFoundException: CWIML1010E: The user registry operation could not be completed. The uniqueId = null and uniqueName = null attributes of the identifier object are either not valid or not defined in the back-end repository.
	at com.ibm.ws.security.registry.internal.UserRegistryWrapper.getGroupsForUser(UserRegistryWrapper.java:248)
	at web.UserRegistryServlet.handleMethodRequest(UserRegistryServlet.java:140)
	at web.UserRegistryServlet.doGet(UserRegistryServlet.java:174)
	at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:687)
	at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:790)
	at com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.servlet.ServletWrapper.service(ServletWrapper.java:1258)
	... 
----
+
This issue has been resolved and the method no longer throws `EntryNotFoundException`.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/24939[`requestTiming-1.0` causes elevated (or spiking) CPU performance due to the `SlowRequestManager` ]
+
When using the `requestTiming-1.0` feature in OpenLiberty, the CPU usage is elevated. CPU impact correlates to CPU capacity. 
+
This is more obvious when a lower threshold is set for the "slow request" threshold (i.e. e.g. `\<= 15s`). Even so, may not encounter a noticeable impact depending on CPU capacity. 
+
This is also more obvious if the request has a high hung threshold or if the request is hung indefinitely and can not be terminated by by the `interruptHungRequest` attribute (leading to an indefinite hang). This allows for a bigger window of opportunity to witness any CPU spikes/elevation.
+
This issue has been resolved and the elevated CPU usage no longer occurs.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/25152[Request Timing metrics not showing up with `mpMetrics-5.0` (when used with `requestTiming-1.0` feature).]
+
When using the `mpMetrics-5.0` and `requestTiming-1.0` features, the request timing metrics are not being provided.
+
This issue has been resolved and the expected request timing metrics are now provided.
