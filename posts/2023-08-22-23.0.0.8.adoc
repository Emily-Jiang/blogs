With Open Liberty's new Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) support in OpenID Connect clients, you can prevent authorization code interception attacks, which can occur in certain very specific scenarios. Also in this release, the `featureUtility installFeature` command is updated to better manage dependencies among the features that it installs. We've also got a new guide on using OpenTelemetry and Jaeger.

* <<pkce, Prevent authorization code interception attacks with PKCE support for OpenID Connect clients>>
* <<featureinstall, Ensure sufficient features are installed when using `featureUtility installFeature` command>>
* <<CVEs, Security Vulnerability (CVE) fixes>>

Along with the new features and functions added to the runtime, weâ€™ve also made <<guides, updates to our guides>>.

[#pkce]
== Prevent authorization code interception attacks with PKCE support for OpenID Connect clients
OpenID Connect clients in Liberty now support Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) (link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636[RFC 7636]). PKCE is an extension of the OAuth 2.0 specification and provides protection from authorization code interception attacks for OAuth 2.0 public clients. In very specific scenarios, a malicious application can intercept an authorization code intended for a legitimate OAuth 2.0 public client and use the authorization code to obtain access and ID tokens on behalf of the client. PKCE introduces additional steps and request parameters to prevent such interception attacks.

Enable this functionality using the `pkceCodeChallengeMethod` attribute in either the `<openidConnectClient>` or `<oidcLogin>` elements in the `server.xml`.

For example, when you use the OpenID Connect Client feature, include configuration similar to the following example:

[source,xml]
----
    <featureManager>
        <feature>openidConnectClient-1.0</feature>
    </featureManager>
    ...
    <openidConnectClient pkceCodeChallengeMethod="S256" ... />
----

If you are using the Social Media Login feature, include configuration similar to the following example:

[source,xml]
----
    <featureManager>
        <feature>socialLogin-1.0</feature>
    </featureManager>
    ...
    <oidcLogin pkceCodeChallengeMethod="S256" ... />
----

For more information about the configuration options, refer to the docs for the link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/config/openidConnectClient.html[openidConnectClient element] and the link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/config/oidcLogin.html[oidcLogin element].

[#featureinstall]
== Ensure sufficient features are installed when using `featureUtility installFeature` command
When `featureUtility installFeature <featurename>` is used to install a feature on the command line, the feature and all required dependencies are installed.

However, this doesn't guarantee that the feature will start correctly when used with other features in the server, particularly for features that can work with multiple versions of other features. This means that you could list all the features you wanted to use on the command line but find that they didn't all work together because `featureUtility` hadn't installed the right version of every dependency.

To prevent this problem, running `featureUtility installFeature <featurename>` now installs all versions of any dependencies required by the requested feature, which might result in a larger number of features being installed in some circumstances.

The similar command `featureUtility installServerFeatures <servername>` was not affected by this problem and its behaviour is unchanged. Using `installServerFeatures` is the recommended way to install features as it always installs exactly the minimum set of features needed for the given server configuration.

[#guides]
== New and updated guides since the previous release

As Open Liberty features and functionality continue to grow, we continue to add link:https://openliberty.io/guides/?search=new&key=tag[new guides to openliberty.io] on those topics to make their adoption as easy as possible.  We also update existing guides to address any reported bugs/issues, keep their content current, and expand what their topics cover.
