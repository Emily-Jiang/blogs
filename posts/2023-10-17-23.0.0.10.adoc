Java 21 is finally here, the first long-term support (LTS) release since Java 17 was released two years ago. It offers some new functionality and changes that youâ€™ll want to check out for yourself. In particular, there's the introduction of Virtual Threads.

In this release, we also have an update to the `featureUtility` command which now verifies feature authenticity by default when you install a new feature in to Liberty.

Java 21 is finally here, the first long-term support (LTS) release since Java 17 was released two years ago. It offers some new functionality and changes that you'll want to check out for yourself.

Take advantage of trying out the new changes in Java 21 now and to test out your applications, microservices, and runtime environments.

To run Open Liberty with Java 21:

1. Download and install the link:https://openliberty.io/start/#runtime_releases[23.0.0.10 version], or later, of Open Liberty.
2. Download the latest release of Java 21 from one of these providers:
    * link:https://jdk.java.net/21/[jdk.java.net]
    * Adoptium 
    ** link:https://adoptium.net/temurin/nightly/?version=21[Early access nightly builds]
    ** link:https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=21[Full release] (once available)
3. Edit your Open Liberty server's link:/docs/latest/reference/config/server-configuration-overview.html#server-env[server.env file] to point JAVA_HOME to your Java 21 installation
4. Start testing!

[#feature]
== featureUtility now verifies feature signatures by default

The `featureUtility` command line tool now verifies feature signatures before installing the feature in to the Liberty runtime. 

Previously, the `featureUtilty` tool only verified checksums. While checksums are essential for integrity (showing that the file has not tampered with), verifying checksums did not ensure the authenticity of downloaded files---whether the feature originated from the Liberty development team or is a user feature.

We've now implemented an additional step in the process of verifying feature signatures to check both the authenticity and integrity of features that are downloaded from the Maven Central repository.

When running the `featureUtility` command:

* The default behavior is now `--verify=enforce`, meaning that it verifies all specified Liberty features.
* To keep the old behavior instead, you can skip the verification process by using the parameter `--verify=skip`.
* You can alternatively set the verification option through environment variables or `featureUtility.properties` file.

For more information, see:

* link:/docs/latest/reference/command/featureUtility-installFeature.html#_options[featureUtility installFeature command docs]
* link:/docs/latest/reference/command/featureUtility-installServerFeatures.html[featureUtility installServerFeature command docs]
