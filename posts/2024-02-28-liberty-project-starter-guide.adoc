This blog has been introduced to assist users in getting started with the Open Liberty project. As a summary post, it will help you understand setting up the required Liberty environment with Open Liberty Starter, Maven/Gradle project structures, and the usage of Liberty tools within an IDE.

In this blog, you will learn how to start the Open Liberty project from the following aspects:

* <<prerequisites, Required Foundations: Java and Maven Prerequisites>>
* <<libertyStarter, Efficient Open Liberty Project Launch: Open Liberty Starter>>
* <<AboutProject, About the Liberty Maven/Gradle project>>
* <<LibertyTools, Installing Liberty Tools for IDE Enhancement>>
* <<ImportProject, Importing the Project into IDEs>>

[#prerequisites]
== Required Foundations: Java and Maven Prerequisites

To initiate the Open Liberty project on your end, it is necessary to install Java and Maven. When following Open Liberty guides, please be aware that each guide may necessitate a specific Java version, as indicated at the beginning of the guide.

Please refer to the link for setting up:

- Java https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/java-se.html
- Maven https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

[#libertyStarter]
== Efficient Open Liberty Project Launch: Open Liberty Starter

The Open Liberty Starter provides a simple way for initiating an Open Liberty project. Visit the link:https://openliberty.io/start/[Open Liberty Starter page], define your application and project name, select a build tool (either Maven or Gradle), and indicate the preferred versions of Java SE, Jakarta EE, and MicroProfile for your application. Finally, click on `Generate Project` to download your project seamlessly.

Once you download the starter project, unpack the `.zip` file on your machine.

If you selected Maven as your build tool, then open a command line session, navigate to the installation directory, and run `mvn liberty:run`. This will install all required dependencies and start the default server. If successful, you will see the necessary features installed and the message `server is ready to run a smarter planet`.

```

```

If you selected Gradle as your build tool, then open a command line session, navigate to the installation directory, and run `./gradlew libertyStart` to start the default server. If successful, you will see the message `server is ready to run a smarter planet`.

[#AboutProject]
== About the Liberty Maven/Gradle project

=== Maven Project
Derived from the demo project mentioned in the section <<libertyStarter, Efficient Open Liberty Project Launch: Open Liberty Starter>>, within the `MAVEN-APP` directory, the `pom.xml` (Project Object Model) file containing configuration details for the project, encompassing dependencies, plugins, and other settings.

==== Declare dependencies in "pom.xml"
Maven manage the project through the `pom.xml`. To declare dependencies, `<dependencies>` section should be used. For example:

[source]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>jakarta.platform</groupId>
        <artifactId>jakarta.jakartaee-api</artifactId>
        <version>10.0.0</version>
        <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

In this example, the `groupId`, `artifactId`, and `version` collectively serve to uniquely identify the `jakarta` dependency. The `scope` defines when the dependency is needed (e.g., provide dependency at runtime or testing).

For adding or updating dependencies in a Maven project, you can visit the link:https://mvnrepository.com/[Maven Library] for more information.

==== Adding plugins in "pom.xml"
Plugins enhance the functionality of Maven by providing additional capabilities. Common plugins encompass tasks such as compiling code, running tests, packaging applications, and more. For instance:

[source]
----
<pluginManagement>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
            <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.10</version>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</pluginManagement>
----

In this example, the `liberty-maven-plugin` from `io.openliberty.tools` has been introduced as a plugin for this project. 

=== Gradle Project
Examine the `GRADLE-APP` demo project directory to locate the `build.gradle` file. It plays a similar role to the `pom.xml` file in a Maven project.

==== Declare dependencies in "build.gradle"
To declare dependencies, you can use the `dependencies` block in build.gradle file. For example:

[source]
----
dependencies {
    // provided dependencies
    providedCompile 'jakarta.platform:jakarta.jakartaee-api:10.0.0' 
}
----

==== Adding plugins in "build.gradle"
In Gradle, plugins may be applied directly or introduced via the `plugins` block. For instance:

[source]
----
plugins {
    id 'war'
    id 'io.openliberty.tools.gradle.Liberty' version '3.8'
}
----

=== Project structure

A well-organized file structure is crucial for Maven and Gradle projects, providing a clear framework for development. This hierarchy includes directories for application code, MicroProfile, Liberty configuration and tests.

==== Maven Project

image::img/blog/MAVEN-APP-directory-img.png[MAVEN-APP directory image,width=50%,align="center"]

Referring to the demo Maven project's structure shown in the picture: 

- `src/main/java`: Java application code files
- `src/main/liberty/config`: Liberty configuration files
- `src/main/resources/META-INF`: MicroProfile configuration files
- `src/test`: Test files

==== Gradle Project

image::img/blog/GRADLE-APP-directory-img.png[GRADLE-APP directory image,width=50%,align="center"]

Referring to the demo Gradle project's structure shown in the picture:

- `src/main/java`: Java application code files
- `src/main/liberty/config`: Liberty configuration files
- `src/main/resources/META-INF`: MicroProfile configuration files
- `src/test`: Test files

[#LibertyTools]
== Installing Liberty Tools for IDE Enhancement
This section will provide links to the installation documents for the Liberty Tools on specific Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

- Installing link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/liberty-tools-eclipse/blob/main/docs/installation.md[Liberty Tools for Eclipse].

- Installing link:https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14856-liberty-tools[Liberty Tools for IntelliJ IDEA].

- Installing link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Open-Liberty.liberty-dev-vscode-ext[Liberty Tools for Visual Studio Code]

[#ImportProject]
== Importing the Project into IDEs

=== For IntelliJ IDEA and Visual Studio Code
When utilizing Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ IDEA as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE), you have the option to either navigate to `File` > `Open..` within the IDE or simply drag and drop the project folder into the IDE window for seamless integration.

=== For Eclipse IDE
If using Eclipse IDE, navigate to `File` > `Import`, then select the import wizard for either Maven or Gradle project. Choose `Existing Maven/Gradle project`, click `Next`, browse the project from the root directory, and finally click `Finish` to complete the import process.

== Begin application development using Liberty Dev Mode and Liberty Tools.
To achieve Liberty development mode or development mode with container, you can either activate it using commands in the terminal: running `mvn liberty:dev` or `mvn liberty:devc`, or use the Liberty Tools. The Liberty Tools offer three methods to assist you in reaching this objective. We recommend consulting the user guide provided with each IDE to effectively utilize the Liberty Tools for development mode. For more information about liberty development mode and container support for development mode, please visit link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/development-mode.html[dev mode document]
