[#prerequisites]
== Foundations Required: Java and Maven Prerequisites

To initiate the Open Liberty project on your end, it is necessary to install Java and Maven. It is recommended to install either Java 17 or Java 21.

Please refer to the link for setting up:

- Java https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/java-se.html
- Maven https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

[#libertyStarter]
== Efficient Launch of Open Liberty Project: Open Liberty Starter

The Open Liberty Starter provides a simple way for initiating an Open Liberty project. Visit the link:https://openliberty.io/start/[Open Liberty Starter page], define your application and project name, select a build tool (either Maven or Gradle), and indicate the preferred versions of Java SE, Jakarta EE, and MicroProfile for your application. Finally, click on `Generate Project` to download your project seamlessly.

Once you download the starter project, unpack the `.zip` file on your machine.

[#ImportProject]
== Importation of the Project into IDEs

=== For IntelliJ IDEA and Visual Studio Code
When utilizing Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ IDEA as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE), you have the option to either navigate to `File` > `Open..` within the IDE or simply drag and drop the project folder into the IDE window for seamless integration.

=== For Eclipse IDE
If using Eclipse IDE, navigate to `File` > `Import`, then select the import wizard for either Maven or Gradle project. Choose `Existing Maven/Gradle project`, click `Next`, browse the project from the root directory, and finally click `Finish` to complete the import process.


[#AboutProject]
== Overview of the Liberty Maven/Gradle Project

=== Project Dependencies and Plugins

Derived from the demo project unpacked in the section <<libertyStarter, Efficient Open Liberty Project Launch: Open Liberty Starter>>.

==== Maven Project
If you are working with Maven as your build tool, within the `maven-app` directory, the `pom.xml` (Project Object Model) file containing configuration details for the project, encompassing dependencies, plugins, and other settings.

==== Declare dependencies in "pom.xml"
Maven manage the project through the `pom.xml`. To declare dependencies, `<dependencies>` section should be used. For example:

[source]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>jakarta.platform</groupId>
        <artifactId>jakarta.jakartaee-api</artifactId>
        <version>10.0.0</version>
        <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

For adding or updating dependencies in a Maven project, you can visit the link:https://mvnrepository.com/[Maven Library] for more information.

==== Adding plugins in "pom.xml"
Plugins enhance the functionality of Maven by providing additional capabilities. Common plugins encompass tasks such as compiling code, running tests, packaging applications, and more. For instance:

[source]
----
<pluginManagement>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
            <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.10</version>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</pluginManagement>
----

==== Gradle Project
If you selected Gradle as your build tool, examine the `gradle-app` demo project directory to locate the `build.gradle` file. It plays a similar role to the `pom.xml` file in a Maven project.

==== Declare dependencies in "build.gradle"
To declare dependencies, you can use the `dependencies` block in build.gradle file. For example:

[source]
----
dependencies {
    // provided dependencies
    providedCompile 'jakarta.platform:jakarta.jakartaee-api:10.0.0' 
}
----

==== Adding plugins in "build.gradle"
In Gradle, plugins may be applied directly or introduced via the `plugins` block. For instance:

[source]
----
plugins {
    id 'war'
    id 'io.openliberty.tools.gradle.Liberty' version '3.8'
}
----

=== Project structure

A well-organized file structure is crucial for Maven and Gradle projects, providing a clear framework for development. This hierarchy includes directories for application code, MicroProfile, Liberty configuration and tests.

==== Maven Project

image::img/blog/MAVEN-APP-directory-img.png[MAVEN-APP directory image,width=40%,align="center"]

Referring to the demo Maven project's structure shown in the picture: 

- `src/main/java`: Java application code files
- `src/main/liberty/config`: Liberty configuration files
- `src/main/resources/META-INF`: MicroProfile configuration files
- `src/test`: Test files
- `Dockerfile`: Dockerfile for building the Docker image
- `mvnw`/`mvnw.cmd`: Maven Wrapper script for Unix-like/Windows systems

==== Gradle Project

image::img/blog/GRADLE-APP-directory-img.png[GRADLE-APP directory image,width=40%,align="center"]

Referring to the demo Gradle project's structure shown in the picture:

- `src/main/java`: Java application code files
- `src/main/liberty/config`: Liberty configuration files
- `src/main/resources/META-INF`: MicroProfile configuration files
- `src/test`: Test files
- `Dockerfile`: Dockerfile for building the Docker image
- `gradlew`/`gradlew.bat`: Gradle Wrapper script for Unix-like/Windows systems.

[#LibertyTools]
== Introduction to Liberty Tools
Liberty Tools enhances the application development experience with Open Liberty by providing convenient features. It includes a Liberty Dashboard for organizing projects and integrates Liberty dev mode directly into your IDE. The Liberty Dashboard neatly manages Maven and Gradle projects, automatically adding configurations for Open Liberty. With just a few clicks, you can start or stop your app, run tests, and check reports. Liberty dev mode swiftly applies code changes to your running app without needing to restart the server, ensuring faster development.

[#LibertyToolsInstallation]
== Installation of Liberty Tools for IDE Enhancement

[#libertyToolsWithDevMode]
== Initiation of Application Development using Liberty Dev Mode and Liberty Tools
To enable Liberty development mode or development mode with container, you can activate it using commands in the terminal: 

If Maven is your chosen build tool, then open a command line session, navigate to the installation directory, and run `mvn liberty:dev` or `mvn liberty:devc`. This will install all required dependencies and start the default server in dev mode or dev mode with container. If successful, you will see the necessary features installed and the message `Liberty is running in dev mode.`.

[role='no_copy']
```

[#tryLibertyTools]
== Try it now: Liberty dev mode

Dev mode can automatically detect, recompile, and deploy code changes whenever you save a new change in your IDE or text editor. To try out this feature, an example of creating a simple REST Resource Java File is provided.

Please check out the either `maven-app` or `gradle-app` project and ensure that Liberty dev mode is running for your project. Then, create a new Java class file named `HelloWorldResource.java` for your REST resource.

[role='no_copy']
```
src/main/java/com/demo/rest/HelloWorldResource.java
```

and paste following code into the file: 

[source,java]
```
package com.demo.rest;

import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Produces;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

@Path("/hello")
public class HelloWorldResource{

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String helloWorld() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
}
```

Once the console displays `Web application available (default_host)`, it indicates that the Liberty server has successfully detected, recompiled and deployed changed. You can now view the message drafted in the example by accessing the link: 

- For `maven-app`: http://localhost:9080/maven-app/api/hello
- For `gradle-app`: http://localhost:9080/gradle-app/api/hello

// introduce start with dev mode
