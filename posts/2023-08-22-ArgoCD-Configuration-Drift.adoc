//Blank line here is necessary before starting the body of the post.

// // // // // // // //
// In the preceding section:
// Do not insert any blank lines between any of the lines.
//
// "open-graph-image" is set to OL logo. Whenever possible update this to a more appropriate/specific image (for example if present an image that is being used in the post). 
// However, it can be left empty which will set it to the default
//
// "open-graph-image-alt" is a description of what is in the image (not a caption). When changing "open-graph-image" to
// a custom picture, you must provide a custom string for "open-graph-image-alt".
//
// Replace TITLE with the blog post title
//
// Replace SECOND_AUTHOR_NAME with the name of the second author.
// Replace SECOND_GITHUB_USERNAME with the GitHub user name of the second author.
// Replace THIRD_AUTHOR_NAME with the name of the third author. And so on for fourth, fifth, etc authors.
// Replace THIRD_GITHUB_USERNAME with the GitHub user name of the third author. And so on for fourth, fifth, etc authors.
//
// Replace AUTHOR_NAME with your name as first author.
// Replace GITHUB_USERNAME with your GitHub username eg: lauracowen
// Replace DESCRIPTION with a short summary (~60 words) of the release (a more succinct version of the first paragraph of the post).
//
// Replace AUTHOR_NAME with your name as you'd like it to be displayed, eg: Laura Cowen
//
// Example post: 2020-02-12-faster-startup-Java-applications-criu.adoc
//
// If adding image into the post add :
// -------------------------
// [.img_border_light]
// image::img/blog/FILE_NAME[IMAGE CAPTION ,width=70%,align="center"]
// -------------------------
// "[.img_border_light]" = This adds a faint grey border around the image to make its edges sharper. Use it around
// screenshots but not around diagrams. Then double check how it looks.
// There is also a "[.img_border_dark]" class which tends to work best with screenshots that are taken on dark backgrounds.
// Once again make sure to double check how it looks
// Change "FILE_NAME" to the name of the image file. Also make sure to put the image into the right folder which is: img/blog
// change the "IMAGE CAPTION" to a couple words of what the image is
// // // // // // // //

Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) is a process in which developers frequently merge code changes into a source code repository, which then triggers code builds, runs security scans, runs tests, and then deploys the application. Automation of this process, through adopting a DevOps culture, tools, and processes, enables organizations to release on a more frequent basis without compromising on quality. Various tools are available to automate the CI/CD process that can be readily integrated into a DevOps deployment pipeline. In this blog post, we'll give an opinionated way on how you can use link:https://www.jenkins.io/[Jenkins] to automate the CI process for building, testing, and how to use link:https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/[ArgoCD] for deploying and monitoring your cloud-native Java applications that run on link:https://openliberty.io[Open Liberty] into link:https://kubernetes.io[Kubernetes]. The approach used in this blog is to do the development environment deployment using the jenkins directly and trigger the deployment on test and higer environment using ArgoCD based on the pull request on GitHub. As the CI/CD process is triggered by source changes in Git, this is also known as the GitOps approach to DevOps. ArgoCD will help to fix configuration drift issue between containers and source repository like github.
