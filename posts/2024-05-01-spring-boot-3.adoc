As of version 23.0.0.9, Liberty offers support for Spring Boot 3.1, allowing developers to take advantage of the Spring and Spring Boot libraries while providing a range of https://openliberty.io/blog/2022/10/17/memory-footprint-throughput-update.html[performance] enhancements specifically engineered to provide an industry-leading, first-class platform for Spring Boot applications.

When you package a Spring Boot app in the WAR format, you can choose from two Liberty deployment options, each with a different set of advantages.

You can deploy a Spring Boot WAR  like any standard Jakarta EE WAR by using the same developer tooling and server configuration, and providing a common DevOps workflow with your other Liberty WAR deployments.

Alternatively, you can use a special https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/deploy-spring-boot.html[optimized Liberty deployment for Spring Boot applications]. This optimization adds some configuration options and provides advantages to efficiently build Docker container images.

In this blog post, we'll first create a simple app by using the link:https://start.spring.io/[Spring Initializr], and then deploy it as a WAR to Liberty without any modifications, using the same deployment as for any WAR.

We then show how to optimize the Spring Boot deployment by adding the Liberty Maven Plugin (`liberty-maven-plugin`) and a simple `server.xml` configuration with the `springBoot-3.0` feature. We can then build an efficiently-layered Docker image.


== Prerequisites
- The sample requires Java 21 (though you could be easily rework it to use Java 17)

== Option 1: Deploy your Spring Boot app as standard WAR file

1. Create a project from your browser using link:https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&platformVersion=3.2.5&packaging=war&jvmVersion=21&groupId=demo&artifactId=spring-liberty&name=spring-liberty&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=demo&dependencies=web[this Spring Initializr configuration].
+
2. Add the following Spring web controller file (use the `vi` command here, or your preferred editor).
+
[source,sh]
----
vi src/main/java/demo/HelloController.java
----
+
[source,java]
----
package demo;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello from Spring Boot in Open Liberty!";
    }

}
----
+
3. From the command line, run a standard WAR deployment in https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/development-mode.html[dev mode], with the configuration provided by the `webProfile10` template.
+
[source,sh]
----
./mvnw io.openliberty.tools:liberty-maven-plugin:3.10:dev -Dtemplate=webProfile10 -DskipTests
----
+
4. Test the application by visiting the following URL in a browser: http://localhost:9080/spring-liberty-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/
+
You should see:
+
  Hello from Spring Boot in Open Liberty!
+
5. Stop the server by pressing `Ctrl`+`C` or  by typing `q` and pressing `Enter` to quit dev mode.

=== Results

The app is deployed in dev mode, like you would with any Jakarta EE WAR, without any special configuration or steps specific to Spring Boot.   

The Spring portion of the app is bootstrapped by the web container by using the `SpringBootServletInitializer` extension generated into your application by the **Spring Initializr** and from there you can use the Spring and Spring Boot APIs.

== Option 2: Use the optimized Liberty Spring Boot deployment

This example uses the same Spring app that is created in step 1 of the previous example. By adding some extra configuration in the `pom.xml` and `server.xml`, you can build an efficiently-layered Docker image and also parameterize the app with application arguments.

1. Add liberty-maven-plugin with Spring Boot deployment config to the `pom.xml` file:
+
[source,xml]
----
    <plugin>
        <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
        <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>3.10</version>
        <configuration>
            <appsDirectory>apps</appsDirectory>
            <deployPackages>spring-boot-project</deployPackages>
        </configuration>
    </plugin>
----
+
2. Create your Liberty `server.xml` file by copying from the Spring Boot template.
+
[source,sh]
----
./mvnw clean liberty:create -Dtemplate=springBoot3
mkdir -p src/main/liberty/config/
cp target/liberty/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer/server.xml src/main/liberty/config/server.xml
----
+
3. Add application arguments to your Spring Boot application configuration in the Liberty `server.xml` file.
+
[source,xml]
----
 <springBootApplication id="spring-liberty" location="thin-spring-liberty-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war" name="spring-liberty">
    <applicationArgument>--server.servlet.context-path=/testpath</applicationArgument>
    <applicationArgument>--myarg=myval</applicationArgument>
 </springBootApplication>
----
+
4. Add `println` to echo arguments in the output (use the `vi` command here, or your preferred editor).
+
[source,sh]
----
vi ./src/main/java/demo/SpringLibertyApplication.java
----
+
[source,java]
----
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Arguments array = " + java.util.Arrays.toString(args));
        SpringApplication.run(SpringLibertyApplication.class, args);
    }
----
+
5. Run
+
Although the Liberty Maven Plugin doesn't currently support dev mode when you use the optimized deployment, you can still use the lifecycle built into the 'run' goal.  We do need to do a 'package' first to get the Spring Boot `repackage` packaging.
+
[source,sh]
----
./mvnw package liberty:run
----
+
6.  Observe the output:
+
[source,sh]
----
[INFO] Arguments array = [--server.servlet.context-path=/testpath, --myarg=myval]
[INFO]   .   ____          _            __ _ _
[INFO]  /\\ / ___'_ __ _ _(_)_ __  __ _ \ \ \ \
[INFO] ( ( )\___ | '_ | '_| | '_ \/ _` | \ \ \ \
[INFO]  \\/  ___)| |_)| | | | | || (_| |  ) ) ) )
[INFO]   '  |____| .__|_| |_|_| |_\__, | / / / /
[INFO]  =========|_|==============|___/=/_/_/_/
[INFO]  :: Spring Boot ::                (v3.2.4)
----
+
and also
+
[source,sh]
----
[INFO] [AUDIT   ] CWWKT0016I: Web application available (default_host): http://localhost:9080/testpath/
----
+
7. Test the application by visiting the following URL in a browser: http://localhost:9080/testpath/
+
As before, you should see:
+
  Hello from Spring Boot in Open Liberty!
+
8. When you finish testing the application, stop the server by pressing `Ctrl`+`C`.

=== Results

The server is configured with the https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/feature/springBoot-3.0.html[springBoot-3.0] feature. The `liberty-maven-plugin` is added to the `pom.xml`, along with special configuration to use the optimized Spring Boot deployment.  The app is packaged as an executable WAR by running the `spring-boot:repackage` goal in the `package` phase, and the app is bootstrapped by its `main()` method in `SpringLibertyApplication`, passing in application arguments defined in `server.xml`, without even the need to provide a `SpringBootServletInitializer` implementation.  We can now use the https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/deploy-spring-boot.html#thin[thinning] support to build an efficiently-layered Docker image, which we will show next.

If you're wondering, yes, while a Spring Boot WAR must be repackaged as an executable WAR to use the optimized deployment, that executable WAR could still be deployed as a standard WAR.

=== Build container image with efficient layering

Now that we have used the optimized Spring Boot deployment, we can efficiently build a container image.  This image uses an indexed cache at `/lib.index.cache` to store Spring Boot dependencies in their own layer, separate from your application code.

1. Create your `Dockerfile`.  
+
[source,dockerfile]
----
# Stage and thin the application 
FROM icr.io/appcafe/open-liberty:full-java21-openj9-ubi-minimal as staging

ARG APPNAME=spring-liberty-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war
COPY --chown=1001:0 target/$APPNAME \
  /staging/$APPNAME

RUN springBootUtility thin \
 --sourceAppPath=/staging/$APPNAME \
 --targetThinAppPath=/staging/thin-$APPNAME \
 --targetLibCachePath=/staging/lib.index.cache

FROM icr.io/appcafe/open-liberty:kernel-slim-java21-openj9-ubi-minimal

ARG APPNAME=spring-liberty-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war
ARG VERSION=1.0
ARG REVISION=SNAPSHOT
COPY --chown=1001:0 src/main/liberty/config/server.xml /config/server.xml

RUN features.sh

COPY --chown=1001:0 --from=staging /staging/lib.index.cache /lib.index.cache
COPY --chown=1001:0 --from=staging /staging/thin-$APPNAME \
                    /config/apps/thin-$APPNAME

RUN configure.sh 
----
+
(Note you can use the `full-java17-openj9-ubi` tag to build the equivalent Java 17 image.)
+
2. Build then run the image.
+
[source,sh]
----
docker build -t springboot:demo .
docker run -p 9080:9080 -p 9443:9443 -it springboot:demo
----

== Results

To recap, you can deploy a Spring Boot WAR to Liberty like any other WAR, or you can configure an optimized deployment using special `liberty-maven-plugin` configuration and the `springBoot-3.0` feature in the `server.xml` file.
Though much of the programming model is the same across the two cases, there are some differences, including the bootstrap mechanism and the ability to create more efficient Docker layers with the optimized deployment.
