[#verify_key]
== Verify the authenticity of the Open Liberty public key

The Open Liberty project uses its private key to digitally sign each Open Liberty release. You can use the Open Liberty public key to check the signature, verify that the package was released by Open Liberty, and that it was not modified since its release. Starting in version 24.0.0.1, you can also verify the authenticity of the Liberty public key by using a provided certificate (`.cer`) file. For more information, see link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/verifying-package-signatures.html[Verifying Open Liberty release package signatures].
