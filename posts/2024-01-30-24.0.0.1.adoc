[#instanton_features]
== Instant On support for jaxws/xmlws and other features

link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/instanton.html[Open Liberty InstantOn] provides fast startup times for MicroProfile and Jakarta EE applications.

InstantOn supports link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/instanton.html#supported-features[a subset of Open Liberty features]. Any public features that are enabled outside of this set of supported features cause the checkpoint to fail with an error message. As of the 24.0.0.1 release, the following features are enhanced to support InstantOn, in addition to the set of features included initial Liberty InstantOn 23.0.0.6 release:

- `jaxws-2.2` (24.0.0.1 and later)
- `xmlWS-3.0` (24.0.0.1 and later)
- `xmlWS-4.0` (24.0.0.1 and later)
- `jdbc-4.1` (23.0.0.9 and later)
- `jdbc-4.3` (23.0.0.9 and later)
- `appSecurity-1.0` (23.0.0.10 and later)
- `javaMail-1.6` (23.0.0.10 and later)
- `mail-2.0` (23.0.0.10 and later)
- `mail-2.1` (23.0.0.10 and later)
- `passwordUtilities-1.0` (23.0.0.10 and later)
- `localConnector-1.0` (23.0.0.11 and later)

This enhancement enables you to rapidly deploy applications that use these features by using Open Liberty InstantOn. For more information, see link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/instanton.html[Faster startup for containerized applications with Open Liberty InstantOn].

[#verify_key]
== Verify the authenticity of the Open Liberty public key

The Open Liberty project uses its private key to digitally sign each Open Liberty release. You can use the Open Liberty public key to check the signature, verify that the package was released by Open Liberty, and that it was not modified since its release. Starting in version 24.0.0.1, you can also verify the authenticity of the Liberty public key by using a provided certificate (.cer) file.

Certificate files are available for all Open Liberty releases from version 23.0.0.1 and later. For more information, see link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/verifying-package-signatures.html[Verifying Open Liberty release package signatures].

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/27093[mpMetrics-5.0 Feature Returns Response in ISO-8859-1 Instead of UTF-8 when Accessing /metrics Endpoint]
+
When enabling the `mpMetrics-5.0` feature in Open Liberty to support MicroProfile Metrics 5.0, there is an issue with the character encoding of the response returned from the `/metrics` endpoint. Instead of responding with the expected UTF-8 encoding, the server erroneously returns the response in ISO-8859-1 encoding. As a consequence of this encoding issue, non-ASCII characters included in the `# HELP` section of the response are becoming garbled. `mpMetrics-4.0` and `mpMetrics-3.0` respond with UTF-8 correctly.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/25612[Missing packages in public feature doc]
+
The feature list generator (which is used by the old Liberty Eclipse tools and by the doc generator) doesn't roll up the `IBM-API-Package` and `IBM-SPI-Package` headers from private features to public features. The reason for this is that many private features are referenced from multiple public features so it ended up with a lot of public features showing non-core API that was enabled. This means that when the legacy tools tried to work out what features to enable in `server.xml` they often got it wrong because they had no hint of which one was best. So we moved the headers to the relevant public feature and stopped the rollup.
+
Over time it seems that this knowledge has been forgotten and the `IBM-API-Package` and `IBM-SPI-Package` have been pushed down into private features. This means these packages are hidden in generated doc which isn't great. A list of private features with these is below:
+
