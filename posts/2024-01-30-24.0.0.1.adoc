== Instant On support for jaxws/xmlws and other features

link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/instanton.html[Open Liberty InstantOn] provides fast startup times for MicroProfile and Jakarta EE applications.

InstantOn supports link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/instanton.html#supported-features[a subset of Open Liberty features]. Any public features that are enabled outside of this set of supported features cause the checkpoint to fail with an error message. As of the 24.0.0.1 release, the following features are enhanced to support InstantOn, in addition to the set of features included initial Liberty InstantOn 23.0.0.6 release:

- `jaxws-2.2` (24.0.0.1 and later)
- `xmlWS-3.0` (24.0.0.1 and later)
- `xmlWS-4.0` (24.0.0.1 and later)
- `jdbc-4.1` (23.0.0.9 and later)
- `jdbc-4.3` (23.0.0.9 and later)
- `appSecurity-1.0` (23.0.0.10 and later)
- `javaMail-1.6` (23.0.0.10 and later)
- `mail-2.0` (23.0.0.10 and later)
- `mail-2.1` (23.0.0.10 and later)
- `passwordUtilities-1.0` (23.0.0.10 and later)
- `localConnector-1.0` (23.0.0.11 and later)

This enhancement enables you to rapidly deploy applications that use these features by using Open Liberty InstantOn. For more information, see link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/instanton.html[Faster startup for containerized applications with Open Liberty InstantOn].

Also new in 24.0.0.1, InstantOn supports Power and Z (s390x) processor architecture when you run IBM Semeru Java 21. Previously, only X86-64/AMD64 processor architecture was supported.

== Verify the authenticity of the Open Liberty public key

The Open Liberty project uses its private key to digitally sign each Open Liberty release. You can use the Open Liberty public key to check the signature, verify that the package was released by Open Liberty, and that it was not modified since its release. Starting in version 24.0.0.1, you can also verify the authenticity of the Liberty public key by using a provided certificate (`.cer`) file.


== Get Open Liberty 24.0.0.1 now

Available through <<run,Maven, Gradle, Docker, and as a downloadable archive>>.
