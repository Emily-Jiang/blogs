== Why is there a need for true-to-production tests?

In a world where our cloud-native Java applications are often deployed to the cloud with the use of containers, it makes sense that we should be testing our applications in containers as well. As the link:https://developer.ibm.com/articles/creating-a-12-factor-application-with-open-liberty/[12 Factor] and link:https://developer.ibm.com/articles/15-factor-applications/[15 factor] methodologies promote, ensuring parity between our deployment environments is critical for us to have confidence in our application's expected behaviour and spotting/solving bugs.

Containers are an important part of this parity. One of the great benefits of containers (and container technologies like Docker) is that we get a nice consistent package that contains everything we need, down to the OS, meaning it’s portable to any hardware. So why not use these technologies to obtain these benefits when it comes to testing our applications and ensure we get consistent testing environments too?!

So then how then can we effectively utilise containers in our tests and ensure we're testing our applications in a mannor that is as true to production as possible? This is where the Testcontainers framework can help.

== What is the Testcontainers framework?

link:https://testcontainers.com/[Testcontainers] is an open source library that provides containers as a resource at test time, creating consistent and portable testing environments. Breaking it down, it essentially wraps Docker in a Java API and offers first-class integration with JUnit.

== Why is Testcontainers helpful?

Although this technology is especially useful for applications that have external resource dependencies (such as databases, message queues, or web services), one of the most important features of Testcontainers is the generic support it has for any Docker image. By encapsulating any necessary dependencies in containers, Testcontainers simplifies the configuration process and ensures a uniform testing setup that closely mirrors production environments.

In essence, with TestContainers, you can run your tests in an isolated and controlled environment that closely resembles your production setup, ensuring that your tests are reliable and reproducible.

As well as this increased reliability and reproducibility of tests, there are additional key features/benefits that make Testcontainers a really useful tool, including:

* Offering a wide range of supported containers

TestContainers offers support for a large array of Docker containers, including databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, DB2, Redis), messaging brokers (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka), web servers, and more. This diversity enables developers to be able to customise test environments to make them specific to their own application stack.

* Integration with popular testing frameworks

TestContainers integrates with popular testing frameworks including JUnit, TestNG, and Spock. This enables developers to easily and efficiently incorporate Testconatiners into their testing suite without having to make significant changes to their existing tests.

* Declarative Configuration

TestContainers provides a simple, declarative API for configuring and deploying containers. Developers are able to define any desired properties of a container using code, making it easy to configure and maintain.

* Lifecycle Management

TestContainers also handles the lifecycle of containers, ensuring they are started before the tests run and, importantly, stopped afterward. This automautoation removes this responsibility from the shoulders of developers, eliminating the need for manual intervention and making it easy to maintain clean, isolated testing environments.

* Wait Strategies

To prevent your tests from trying to run before any required containers are set up, Testcontainers has a helpful, built-in wait strategy. This is of particular importance for any services that have tests that rely on services that can take significant time to initialise (e.g. databases).


== How to make use of this in your own applications

In our newest guide, we walk you through how you can add Testconatiners to an existing Java application. This interactive guide shows how to to set up and configure multiple containers, including the Open Liberty Docker container, to simulate a production-like environment for your tests. The guide uses Docker to run an instance of the PostgreSQL database needed in this application for a fast installation and setup.

As Testcontainers is a black-box form of testing, you will need a REST client to be able to trigger the requests for your tests. In this guide we also show how to build a REST test client to accurately verify the application’s behavior by ensuring that it responds correctly to various scenarios and conditions.

Try it out for yourself, either running locally on your own machine or using our cloud-hosted development environment:
